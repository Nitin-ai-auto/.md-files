### Understanding the Colorado Sales Tax and Local Rates

The base Colorado sales tax rate is 2.9%, but cities, counties, and special districts can add local taxes, significantly increasing the total rate depending on where a sale occurs. Colorado's tax structure is unique because not every city and county collects the same amount, and home-rule cities can set their own rates and rules. The Colorado Sales Tax Calculator accounts for these complexities by integrating state, county, and city-specific rates in real time.

*   Base state rate of 2.9% plus local taxes

*   Home-rule cities set their own rates
