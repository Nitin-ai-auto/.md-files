### What’s Taken Out of Your Oregon Paycheck?

Before your salary hits your bank account, several deductions lower your gross earnings. Otto AI factors in all federal and state-level taxes, along with pre-tax benefits, to show you your actual Oregon take-home pay.

*   **Federal Income Tax**

The IRS taxes income based on brackets that range from 10% to 37% depending on your earnings and filing status. This is automatically withheld from every paycheck.
*   **FICA Contributions**

These include: Social Security tax: 6.2% of gross wages (up to the wage limit); Medicare tax: 1.45% of gross wages; Additional Medicare tax: 0.9% on earnings above $200,000 for individuals.
*   **Oregon State Income Tax**

Oregon has a graduated state income tax, with rates that range from: 4.75% to 9.9%. Higher earners pay a larger percentage. No local city income taxes (like in Portland or Salem).
*   **Pre-Tax Deductions**

Reduce your taxable income with: 401(k) contributions; Health insurance premiums; Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA). Otto AI’s Oregon salary calculator allows you to enter these deductions for a more tailored estimate of your take-home pay.
