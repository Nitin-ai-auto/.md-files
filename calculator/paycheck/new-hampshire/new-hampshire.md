### Understanding Taxes on Your New Hampshire Paycheck

One of the financial advantages of working in New Hampshire is the absence of a broad state income tax. However, that doesn’t mean you’re free from all deductions. Your paycheck will still be reduced by:

*   **Federal Income Tax:** Based on your income level, marital status, and withholdings.
*   **FICA Taxes:** 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. If your income is over $200,000, you’ll pay an extra 0.9% in Medicare tax.
*   **Pre-Tax Deductions:** Contributions to 401(k), HSA, FSA, and employer-sponsored health insurance may be deducted before taxes are applied.

Although New Hampshire doesn't impose tax on earned wages, it does tax interest and dividend income above certain thresholds. That said, most workers enjoy higher take-home pay compared to income-taxing states. Otto AI NH paycheck calculator uses all the latest tax data to give you an accurate, instant estimate of your net income.

### How to Use the New Hampshire Paycheck Calculator

*   Your gross income (annual or hourly wage)
*   Your pay frequency (weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly)
*   Filing status (single, married, etc.)
*   Number of allowances or dependents
*   Any voluntary deductions like retirement contributions or health premiums

Otto AI then does the rest—instantly generating your net pay with clear line-by-line deductions.
