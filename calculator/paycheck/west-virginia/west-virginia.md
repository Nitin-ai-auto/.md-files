### What Impacts Your Take-Home Pay in West Virginia?

Your paycheck may look simple, but several factors affect how much you actually take home. Use our paycheck calculator West Virginia to understand these key elements:

*   **Federal Income Tax**

*   **FICA Taxes**

These are mandatory contributions toward federal programs: Social Security: 6.2% of wages up to the annual limit; Medicare: 1.45% of all earnings, with an additional 0.9% on income over $200,000. These deductions are automatically taken from each paycheck.
*   **West Virginia State Income Tax**

West Virginia has a progressive state income tax, meaning the rate increases with your income level. For 2025, the state tax brackets range from 2.36% to 5.12%. Use Otto AI West Virginia tax calculator to automatically calculate the exact amount based on your income and filing status.

Some of your earnings might be directed toward pre-tax benefits, such as: 401(k) or retirement contributions, Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Employer-sponsored health insurance. These reduce your taxable income and therefore, the taxes deducted from your paycheck.
