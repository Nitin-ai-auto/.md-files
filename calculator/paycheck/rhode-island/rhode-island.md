### How Your Rhode Island Paycheck Works

Your paycheck begins with your gross earnings—your salary or hourly wage multiplied by hours worked. Rhode Island’s progressive income tax means higher earners pay a greater percentage in state income tax. Combined with federal income tax, FICA taxes, and your pre-tax deductions, these reduce your net pay.

Key paycheck deductions in Rhode Island include:

*   Federal Income Tax: Based on IRS tax brackets and your W-4 elections.
*   Rhode Island State Income Tax: Ranges from 3.75% to 5.99% depending on taxable income.
*   FICA Taxes: 6.2% Social Security tax and 1.45% Medicare tax, plus 0.9% additional Medicare surtax for individuals earning over $200,000 or joint filers over $250,000.
*   Other Pre-Tax Deductions: Such as contributions to 401(k), HSA, or employer-sponsored health insurance.

Employers match your Social Security and Medicare contributions. If you’re self-employed, you must pay both the employee and employer portions—a total of 15.3% in self-employment tax, which our paycheck calculator RI automatically factors in.
