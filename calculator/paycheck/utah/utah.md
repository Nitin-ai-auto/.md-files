### How Does a Paycheck Work in Utah?

Each pay period, your employer withholds a portion of your earnings for taxes and other deductions. The amount you receive as your net income—or take-home pay—is your gross income minus taxes and pre-tax contributions.

*   **Federal Income Tax**

Federal taxes are deducted based on: Your gross earnings, Filing status (single, married, head of household), W-4 selections, including dependents and other withholdings. Federal tax brackets range from 10% to 37%, depending on your income level.
*   **Utah State Income Tax**

Unlike states with graduated tax rates, Utah has a flat state income tax rate of 4.65% for all taxpayers, regardless of income level. This means: If you earn more, you pay more in dollars, but the rate stays the same. Your filing status does not affect the rate, but it may affect deductions. Otto AI Utah tax calculator factors this flat rate into your paycheck analysis.
*   **FICA Taxes**

The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) includes: Social Security: 6.2% of wages up to the annual limit; Medicare: 1.45% on all wages, plus an extra 0.9% if you earn over $200,000. Our Utah salary calculator includes these standard deductions accurately.
*   **Pre-Tax Benefits & Deductions**

If you contribute to things like: Health insurance premiums, 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plans, Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA). These amounts reduce your taxable income, effectively lowering your total tax liability. Otto AI take home pay calculator Utah accounts for these benefits.
