Paycheck Calculator By States
-----------------------------

Use Otto AI Illinois Paycheck Calculator to accurately estimate your take-home pay after federal and state taxes, as well as any deductions. Illinois has a flat state income tax rate, making it unique compared to many other states with progressive tax systems. Whether you’re an employee, freelancer, or small business owner, our paycheck calculator Illinois helps you budget with confidence.

### How Your Illinois Paycheck Works

Your paycheck reflects your gross earnings reduced by required tax withholdings and optional pre-tax deductions. Illinois has a flat income tax rate of 4.95%, which applies to all taxable income. When you add federal income tax and FICA taxes, these deductions significantly lower your take-home pay.

Key deductions from your paycheck include:

*   Federal Income Tax: Based on your W-4 elections and IRS tax brackets.
*   Illinois State Income Tax: Flat 4.95% of your taxable income.
*   FICA Taxes: 6.2% Social Security tax and 1.45% Medicare tax, with an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax on income above $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly).
*   Other Pre-Tax Deductions: Such as health insurance premiums, 401(k) contributions, or HSA deposits.

Employers match your Social Security and Medicare contributions. If you’re self-employed, you must pay both the employee and employer portions—15.3% total in self-employment tax, which our il paycheck calculator accounts for.

This means many Illinois workers see a monthly gross income over $6,500 in 2023. But your net pay will be lower once taxes and deductions come out. Use our take home pay calculator Illinois to see your estimated net pay.
