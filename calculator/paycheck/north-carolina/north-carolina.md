### What’s Taken Out of Your North Carolina Paycheck?

Before your earnings hit your bank account, several taxes and withholdings are deducted. Our paycheck calculator for North Carolina takes each of these into account:

*   **Federal Income Tax**

Based on your income level, marital status, and W-4 selections, this is the largest deduction for most workers.
*   **FICA Taxes**

You’ll pay 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. Higher-income earners may also pay an additional 0.9% in Medicare tax.
*   **North Carolina State Income Tax**

North Carolina has a flat income tax rate of 4.5% (2024 rate) regardless of how much you earn. This makes the calculation more straightforward compared to states with tiered brackets.
*   **Other Deductions**

You may also have pre-tax deductions for things like: 401(k) or retirement contributions; Health, dental, and vision insurance; Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA). Otto AI factors all these elements into your result, giving you the most accurate estimate possible for your take-home pay in North Carolina.
