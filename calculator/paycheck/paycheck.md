### Paycheck Calculator Guide

While the paycheck calculator simplifies many computations, understanding the underlying processes to calculate paycheck accurately can be beneficial.

#### How to Calculate Net Income

2.   2.Withhold Applicable Taxes: Deduct federal, state, and local taxes.
3.   3.Deduct Post-Tax Contributions: Subtract any after-tax deductions.
4.   4.Apply Wage Garnishments: If applicable, deduct any court-ordered wage garnishments.
5.   5.Result: The remaining amount is the net income.

#### How to Calculate Annual Income

Multiply your gross pay (before deductions) by the number of pay periods in a year.

Example: If you earn $1,500 per week, your annual income is $1,500 × 52 = $78,000. You can easily double-check this using our free paycheck calculator with weekly input.

4.   4.Calculate Tax Percentage: Divide the total taxes by the gross pay to find the percentage deducted.

What is a Paycheck?
-------------------

A paycheck compensates employees for their work. Common delivery schedules include bi-weekly and semi-monthly, though this can vary based on employer preferences and local regulations. Specific agreements, such as those with unions, may also influence paycheck frequency.

### Types of Paychecks

Traditionally, employees received printed checks, but electronic deposits into bank accounts are now more common. Some employers offer alternatives like paycards, which can be beneficial for employees without bank accounts.

### How to Read a Paycheck

Understanding a paycheck involves verifying the accuracy of payment information.

#### Information on a Paycheck:

*   Check number
*   Employer's name and address
*   Employee's name and address
*   Check date
*   Payment amount
*   Employer's bank account and routing numbers
*   Check memo (optional)

#### Information on a Pay Stub:

*   Pay period start and end dates
*   Hours worked
*   Gross pay
*   Net (take-home) pay
*   Federal and state income taxes
*   Local taxes
*   Medicare and Social Security taxes
*   Deductions for benefits
*   Wage garnishments
*   Year-to-date totals
*   Paid time off (PTO) balances

Note: Pay stub requirements can vary by state. Use our free paycheck calculator to verify these amounts based on your current pay frequency and location

Understanding Paychecks: Withholdings and Deductions
----------------------------------------------------

New employees might notice their take-home pay is less than their gross pay due to various deductions:

### Federal Income Tax Withholding

Employers deduct federal income tax based on current rates and the employee's withholding certificate, which includes filing status and other relevant information.

### FICA Withholding

Both employers and employees contribute to FICA taxes:

*   Medicare: 1.45%
*   Social Security: 6.2% (up to a wage base limit)

High-income earners may also be subject to an additional 0.9% Medicare tax.

### State and Local Tax Withholding

Tax rates and requirements vary by region and may include:

*   State and local income tax
*   State unemployment tax (SUTA)
*   Short-term disability
*   Paid family medical leave

### Benefit Deductions

Employers often share the cost of benefits like health insurance and retirement plans with employees, deducting the employee's share from their pay. These deductions can be pre-tax (reducing taxable income) or post-tax.

### Wage Garnishments

Employers may be required to deduct garnishments from wages due to court orders related to debts, unpaid taxes, child support, or alimony.
