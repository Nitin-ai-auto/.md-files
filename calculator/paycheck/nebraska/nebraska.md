How Your Nebraska Paycheck is Calculated
----------------------------------------

Every paycheck starts with gross income—but what matters most is what actually lands in your bank account. Otto AI take home pay calculator for Nebraska accurately breaks down your earnings to show how much goes to federal taxes, state taxes, and other deductions.

Here's how your paycheck is calculated:

*   Federal Income Tax: Based on your income bracket and filing status, the IRS deducts a portion of your pay.
*   FICA Taxes: This includes 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. If you earn above $200,000, an additional 0.9% Medicare tax may apply.
*   Nebraska State Income Tax: Nebraska has a progressive income tax system, with rates ranging from 2.46% to 6.64% depending on your taxable income.
*   No Local Income Taxes: Nebraska does not impose local income taxes, so you don't have to worry about city or county deductions.
*   Pre-tax Contributions: These include retirement savings (401(k)), health insurance premiums, HSA/FSA accounts, and other voluntary deductions that lower your taxable income.
