### How Your California Paycheck Works

Your job probably pays you either an hourly wage or an annual salary. But unless you’re getting paid under the table, your actual take-home pay will be lower than the hourly or annual wage listed on your job contract. The reason for this discrepancy between your salary and your take-home pay has to do with the tax withholdings from your wages that happen before your employer pays you. There may also be contributions toward insurance coverage, retirement funds, and other optional contributions, all of which can lower your final paycheck.

When calculating your take-home pay, the first thing to come out of your earnings are FICA taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Your employer withholds a 6.2% Social Security tax and a 1.45% Medicare tax from your earnings after each pay period. Individuals earning over $200,000 (as well as joint filers over $250,000 and those married but filing separately with incomes above $125,000), also pay a 0.9% Medicare surtax.

Your employer matches the 6.2% Social Security tax and the 1.45% Medicare tax to make up the full FICA tax requirements. If you work for yourself, you’ll have to pay the self-employment tax, which is equal to the employee and employer portions of FICA taxes for a total of 15.3% of your pay. (Luckily, there is a deduction for the part of FICA taxes your employer would normally pay.)

Other factors that can affect the size of your paycheck in California include your marital status, your pay frequency, and what deductions and contributions you make. If you make contributions to your company’s health insurance plan, for example, that payment will be deducted from each paycheck before the money hits your bank account. The same goes for contributions you make to a 401(k) or a Health Savings Account (HSA).

The IRS updated tax withholding guidelines in recent years, changing how your paycheck is calculated. The updated Form W-4 removed allowances and exemptions, instead using a five-step process requiring dollar amounts for things like dependents and additional income.

By using our paycheck calculator california, you’ll see an accurate estimate of your net income after all these deductions.

### So what makes California’s payroll system different?

For one thing, taxes here are considerably higher than in many other states. California has 10 income tax brackets with a progressive structure, meaning if your income is on the low side, you’ll pay a lower tax rate than you would in a flat-tax state.

California’s notoriously high top marginal tax rate of 13.3% (highest in the country) only applies to income above $1 million for single filers and $2 million for joint filers, including an additional 1% mental health services tax on income above $1 million.

While income taxes are high, California’s property tax rates are below the national average. Cities don’t charge their own income taxes, but local sales tax rates can vary, which affects your budget but not your paycheck.

California also requires deductions for state disability insurance (SDI). Your employer withholds 1.1% of your taxable wages for SDI. Before 2024, SDI applied only to wages up to $153,164, but Senate Bill 951 expanded this to include wages above that income.

Some employees receive supplemental wages—overtime, commissions, bonuses, relocation payments, severance, or pay for unused sick leave. In California, these are taxed at flat rates: 10.23% for bonuses and stock options, and 6.6% for all other supplemental wages.

### California Paycheck Tax Calculator

Our California paycheck tax calculator considers:

*   Filing status (single, married, head of household)
*   Pay frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly)
*   Allowances and additional withholdings
*   Pre-tax deductions like 401(k) or HSA contributions

This lets you personalize your calculation for the most accurate result.

### How Much Taxes Are Taken Out of a Paycheck in California?

Wondering how much tax is taken out of paycheck in california? Here’s what typically gets deducted:

*   Federal Income Tax
*   State Income Tax (1% to 13.3% depending on income)
*   FICA Taxes (7.65% combined for Social Security and Medicare)
*   SDI (State Disability Insurance): 1.1% of taxable wages

Our paycheck calculator ca automates these calculations so you don’t have to guess.

Note: In San Francisco, businesses (not employees) face a gross receipts tax on payroll expenses. This is a business tax only, so you won’t see it deducted from your paycheck.

### How You Can Affect Your California Paycheck

While some paycheck withholdings are mandatory, there are steps you can take to influence your take-home pay. Increasing your retirement contributions lowers your paycheck but boosts future savings. Many financial experts recommend raising your retirement savings percentage when you get a raise so you don’t feel the pinch.

Opting for a more expensive health plan or adding dependents can increase your paycheck deductions. If you consistently get large tax refunds, consider updating your W-4 and California DE-4 forms to claim more allowances—this will increase your paychecks but reduce your refund. Conversely, if you owe taxes each year, claim fewer allowances to have more withheld.

In California, your employer can only deduct amounts required by state and federal law or amounts you authorize (e.g., health insurance premiums). Union workers may see additional deductions under collective bargaining agreements, like pension payments.

### Smart Strategies for California Employees

*   Use your paycheck calculator california to:
*   Adjust your W-4 and DE-4 forms to match your tax situation.
*   Optimize retirement savings by maximizing pre-tax contributions.
*   Choose benefits wisely to control your paycheck deductions.
*   Plan your budget with a clear view of your net pay.
