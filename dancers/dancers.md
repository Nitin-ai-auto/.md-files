Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for dancers — focus on the choreography, the clients, and the stage, not the spreadsheets, receipts, or tax drama backstage.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Turn Your Dance Career Into a Legit Business
--------------------------------------------

Otto AI helps you register an LLC or S-Corp to protect your income, write off your training, gear, and travel, and present yourself as the pro you already are.

Contracts

Contracts That Lock In Your Rate, Rights, and Time
--------------------------------------------------

Otto AI includes dancer-friendly templates for performance agreements, class bookings, brand deals, licensing, and collabs—so no one “forgets” to pay you again.
