Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for composers — focus on the score, not the spreadsheets, overdue invoices, or mid-rehearsal tax panic.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Founder · Sorry Dad Co.

Entity Management

Form a Legit Music Business With a Legit Name
---------------------------------------------

Otto AI helps you create an LLC or S-Corp so you can keep your composer income separate, save on taxes, and sound more professional when clients ask for invoices instead of “PayPal again?”

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Every Sample Pack and String Section
----------------------------------------------------

Otto AI tracks your subscriptions, gear upgrades, instrument rentals, notation software, studio rent, orchestration costs, and even the snacks you buy to survive all-nighters. Everything's logged, sorted, and ready when you need it.

Invoicing

Invoicing That Speaks Your Language (and Your Time Signature)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Charge for scoring, revisions, sync licensing, live orchestrations, and even temp tracks. Otto AI builds clean, custom invoices that cover everything from “main theme” to “version 18 final FINAL.”

Contracts That Protect Your Score and Sanity
--------------------------------------------

Otto AI offers contract templates made for composers. Lock in licensing, usage rights, credit terms, project scope, revision limits, and kill fees—because your music isn’t free and your time isn’t infinite.
