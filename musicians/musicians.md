Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for musicians — focus on your craft, not your receipts, overdue payments, or end-of-year tax chaos.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Make Your Music Career Official
-------------------------------

Otto AI helps musicians form an LLC or S-Corp quickly and easily. Separate your band fund from your rent money, protect your income, and look legit when venues and brands come knocking.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Gigs, Gear, and Gas Money
-----------------------------------------

Otto AI automatically tracks and categorizes your expenses—gear, travel, instrument repairs, rehearsal rentals, Spotify promo tools, even strings and snacks. You focus on your setlist—it tracks the rest.

Invoicing

Invoicing That Works for Every Kind of Gig
------------------------------------------

Charge for live shows, studio sessions, teaching, licensing, or songwriting. Otto AI lets you build custom invoices for one-offs, retainers, or tour bundles—because “getting paid” shouldn’t require a follow-up email at 2 a.m.

Contracts

Contracts That Protect Your Work and Your Time
----------------------------------------------

Use Otto AI’s customizable contracts for performances, teaching, collaborations, or licensing. Lock in terms, usage rights, cancellation fees, and expectations—before someone tries to pay you with “exposure.”

Taxes

Tax Help That Hits the Right Key
--------------------------------

Otto AI tracks your income from shows, merch, licensing, sync, and more. It calculates quarterly taxes and keeps your books organized, so April doesn’t feel like an encore you never asked for.

Reports

Know Which Gigs Make You Money (and Which Don’t)
------------------------------------------------

Otto AI shows you which income streams are profitable and which ones are draining your energy. Start charging what you’re worth—backed by real data.
