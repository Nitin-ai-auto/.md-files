Example: Sales Tax Clearance Certificate
----------------------------------------

Let’s say you own a small retail store in Texas and plan to sell it. Before finalizing the sale, the buyer will likely require a sales tax clearance certificate to ensure you’re not leaving behind unpaid sales tax liabilities.

You’d need to:

1.   File all sales tax returns up to the closing date.
2.   Pay any outstanding sales tax.
3.   Request a certificate from the Texas Comptroller’s office.

Only once that’s cleared will the sale move forward.

‍

Common Challenges in Getting a Tax Clearance Certificate
--------------------------------------------------------

**1. Unfiled Tax Returns**

Even if you don’t owe money, missing returns will delay your certificate.

‍

**2. Outstanding Balances**

Any unpaid taxes, penalties, or interest will block approval.

‍

**3. Mismatched Records**

If your business name, EIN, or address doesn’t match state records, it can cause delays.

‍

**4. Processing Delays**

Government agencies may take weeks to process, so plan ahead.

‍

Tip: Apply early. Don’t wait until the last minute, especially if you’re in the middle of a sale or contract bid.
