Have you ever opened your paycheck and thought: _“Wait, why is this less than I expected?”_ You’re not alone. Understanding paycheck deductions can feel like learning a foreign language.

If you live in Texas, there’s good news: like Florida, Texas does not have a state income tax. That means you don’t lose a percentage of your paycheck to state taxes. But that doesn’t mean your paycheck comes to you untouched, federal taxes and other deductions still apply.

In this guide, we’ll break down exactly how much taxes are deducted from a paycheck in Texas, explain what factors influence your take-home pay, and show you how to estimate it using paycheck calculators. By the end, you’ll know where your money is going and how to maximize what you keep.

Why Texas Is a Paycheck-Friendly State
--------------------------------------

#### No State Income Tax

One of the biggest financial perks of living in Texas is that the state does not levy personal income tax.

*   Texas state income tax rate: 0%
*   State-level paycheck deductions: None for income tax

This makes Texas especially attractive compared to high-tax states like California or New York. More of your gross salary goes into your pocket, but federal taxes still apply.

What Taxes Are Deducted from a Texas Paycheck?
----------------------------------------------

Even without state tax, your paycheck in Texas will have several deductions. Let’s look at the main ones:

### 1. Federal Income Tax

This is the biggest chunk of your deductions.

*   Based on your earnings, filing status (single, married, etc.), and allowances on your W-4 form.
*   Tax brackets are progressive, meaning higher portions of your income are taxed at higher rates.

### 2. Social Security Tax

*   Rate: 6.2% of gross wages.
*   Applied only up to the annual wage base limit ($168,600 in 2024).
*   Employers also contribute the same amount, making it 12.4% total.

### 3. Medicare Tax

*   Rate: 1.45% of all wages.
*   No income limit (applies to your entire earnings).
*   An additional 0.9% Medicare surtax applies to income above $200,000.

### 4. Other Deductions (Employer-Dependent)

Depending on your employer, you may also see:

*   Health, dental, or vision insurance premiums
*   401(k) or IRA contributions
*   Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Health Savings Accounts (HSA)
*   Wage garnishments (if applicable)

So when you ask, _“How much taxes are deducted from paycheck Texas?”_ The answer is mostly federal taxes and personal benefits, not state taxes.

#### Example: Texas Paycheck on a $60,000 Salary

Let’s crunch the numbers with an example:

Scenario: Single filer, $60,000 annual salary, no extra deductions.

*   Gross monthly income: $5,000
*   Federal income tax (approx.): $600–700
*   Social Security (6.2%): $310
*   Medicare (1.45%): $72.50
*   Total deductions: ~$1,000–1,100 per month
*   Net take-home pay: ~$3,900–4,000 per month

Note: This is an estimate. For accuracy, use a Texas paycheck calculator.

Federal Tax Brackets and How They Affect Texans
-----------------------------------------------

Since Texas doesn’t tax income, federal tax brackets are the main determinant of how much you owe.

### 2024 Federal Income Tax Brackets (Single Filers)

*   10%: $0 – $11,600
*   12%: $11,601 – $47,150
*   22%: $47,151 – $100,525
*   24%: $100,526 – $191,950
*   32%: $191,951 – $243,725
*   35%: $243,726 – $609,350
*   37%: $609,351+

If you make $60,000, you fall into the 22% bracket, but only part of your income is taxed at that rate. The rest is taxed at lower brackets.

Texas vs Other States: Paycheck Comparison
------------------------------------------

So, how does Texas compare?

*   Texas: No state income tax, lower paycheck deductions.
*   Florida: Similar to Texas, no income tax.
*   California: State income tax up to 13.3%.
*   New York: State income tax up to 10.9%.
