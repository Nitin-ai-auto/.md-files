It simplifies the complex and often time-consuming task of drafting contracts by automating the entire contract generation process, making it quick, easy, and accessible.

How Does an AI Contract Generator Work?
---------------------------------------

Understanding how AI-generated contracts come to life is straightforward. Here's a breakdown of the typical contract generation process:

### Step 1: Selecting a Template

The majority of AI-based contract generators suggest a collection of ready-made templates that apply to different business situations, such as freelance contracts and [non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)](https://joinotto.com/contract/non-disclosure-agreement) or [employment agreements](https://joinotto.com/contract-resources/what-are-employment-agreements) and others.

### Step 2: Inputting Key Details

Once you have chosen a template, Otto AI Contract Generator will ask you to load key information that includes names, dates, words, and special clauses to your contract.

### Step 3: AI-Powered Customization

The AI evaluates what you have said and adjusts the contract to it. Highly-developed algorithms guarantee that the clauses follow the legal requirements and industry-wide conventions, as well as your specific business needs.

### Step 4: Review and Edit

When the contract is created, you can always conveniently revise your AI-generated contract. Most of the platforms have easy modifications, and the finished document is fitted to the needs of your exact requirements.

### Step 5: Signing and Storing

Lastly, AI contract generator platforms usually embed digital signature technologies, making signing of your contracts and easy/safe storage of your made contracts more secure and compliant, thanks to advancements in [AI security](https://www.wiz.io/academy/ai-security-solutions).
