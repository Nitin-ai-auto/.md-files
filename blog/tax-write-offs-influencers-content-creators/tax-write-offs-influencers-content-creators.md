‍

![Image 15: Clothing and Beauty Products](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66fc5ede442e88dc7e56a366/676c4b6ec40debbca94d4404_676c4904d654a32ec1c33a45_Clothing-and-Beauty-Products.avif)

‍

When your personal image is part of your brand, your wardrobe and grooming essentials become more than just style statements — they’re business tools. While you can’t deduct your entire wardrobe, you _can_ write off clothing and beauty products purchased specifically for your content creation work.

These deductions apply when the items are used solely for business purposes, like filming, photoshoots, or brand partnerships.

‍

**Eligible clothing and beauty deductions include:**

*   Outfits purchased for sponsored posts or brand collaborations

*   Makeup, hair, and skincare products used exclusively in tutorials or content shoots

*   Jewelry like [diamond rings](https://laatukoru.fi/en/collections/timanttisormukset), accessories, or props featured in styling or fashion videos

*   Clothing rentals for professional shoots, events, or video productions

**Pro Tip:** To stay compliant with IRS rules, keep clear records of each purchase — including receipts, campaign details, and the specific business purpose. If a product or outfit is ever worn or used outside of your content creation work, it likely won’t qualify as a business deduction. When in doubt, consult with a tax professional to ensure you’re applying these deductions correctly.

‍

### 16. Bank and Financial Fees

‍

‍

Running your influencer business often means managing multiple income streams — sponsorships, affiliate payments, or brand deals. If you maintain a separate business bank account or credit card, the fees associated with those accounts are tax-deductible.

Many creators overlook these small charges, but they can add up significantly over the year.

‍

**Common deductible banking and financial fees include:**

*   Monthly maintenance fees for business bank accounts

*   Annual credit card fees tied to your business account

*   Transaction and payment processing fees (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Venmo Business)

*   Interest payments on business-related loans or balances

*   Wire transfer or foreign transaction fees when working with international brands

*   Overdraft or NSF fees associated with your business banking

**Pro Tip:** If you use tools like Otto, you can automatically track and categorize bank fees to make sure none of these small but valuable deductions slip through the cracks. Automation tools like this are particularly helpful for influencers juggling multiple payment sources and collaborations.

‍

### 17. Office Supplies

‍

![Image 17: Office Supplies](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66fc5ede442e88dc7e56a366/676c4b6ec40debbca94d43f6_676c493f7df4dced003843bd_Office-Supplies.avif)

‍

You may not work in a traditional office, but as a content creator, you definitely use plenty of office supplies to keep your creative business running smoothly. These everyday expenses are fully deductible and can make a noticeable difference at tax time.

**Tax-deductible office supplies include:**

*   Basic materials like pens, notebooks, planners, and sticky notes

*   Printer ink and paper for contracts, invoices, or script printing

*   Shipping materials for brand collaborations or giveaway prizes

*   File folders, binders, and storage organizers for managing paperwork

*   Cleaning supplies for your home studio or recording setup

*   Batteries and cables for filming gear or microphones

*   Desk accessories such as lamps, ergonomic chairs, and mouse pads

Even though these might seem like minor purchases, consistent documentation and tracking can lead to meaningful savings over time.

**Pro Tip:** Keep receipts organized digitally using expense-tracking software or a bookkeeping app. You’ll thank yourself during tax season — especially if your accountant requests itemized proof of purchases.

‍

### **Final Thoughts: Mastering Tax Write-Offs as a Content Creator**
