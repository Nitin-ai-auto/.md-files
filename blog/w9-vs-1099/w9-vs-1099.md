Selecting the correct form depends on the nature of work and payment amounts. Businesses should collect a W-9 early and issue a 1099 when required.

**FAQs**
--------

**1. Can a business refuse to pay me if I don’t provide a W-9 form?**Yes, businesses can withhold payment if they do not receive a completed W-9 form, as they are required to collect your taxpayer identification number for reporting purposes. Without it, they may also be required to apply backup withholding.

‍

**2. What happens if I miss the 1099 filing deadline?**Missing the 1099 filing deadline can result in penalties ranging from $50 to $270 per form, depending on how late it is filed. Intentional disregard of filing requirements can lead to higher penalties and additional fines.

‍

**3. Do I need to file a 1099 form for contractors paid through PayPal or credit cards?**No, if you pay contractors via third-party platforms like PayPal or credit cards, those payment processors may issue a 1099-K instead. However, if payments were made via direct deposit, check, or cash, a 1099-NEC is required if the total exceeds $600.

‍

**4. Is it necessary to request a new W-9 form every year?**Generally, a new W-9 form is not required every year unless there is a change in the contractor’s tax identification details, such as a name change, business structure modification, or updated taxpayer identification number (TIN).

‍

**5. Can I issue a 1099 form without a W-9?**While you can technically issue a 1099 without a W-9, it is not recommended. Without a W-9, you might report incorrect taxpayer details, which can lead to penalties, and you may need to withhold 24% of payments for IRS backup withholding requirements.
