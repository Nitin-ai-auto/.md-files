As a creative professional, your time is best spent doing what you love—creating. Whether you're a [graphic designer](https://joinotto.com/graphic-designers), writer, [photographer](https://joinotto.com/photographers), or any other type of creative, managing finances manually can feel overwhelming and take you away from your craft. From tracking income and expenses to preparing for taxes, these financial tasks can consume hours of your valuable time.

### 3. Invoice Management

Managing invoices manually is one of the most time-consuming aspects of running a creative business. [Creating and sending invoices](https://joinotto.com/invoicing), tracking payments, and following up with clients can easily take hours each month.

**Pro Tip:** Automated invoicing ensures faster payments and helps maintain a professional relationship with clients without the awkward follow-ups.

Taxes are often the most stressful part of being a self-employed creative. Tracking deductible expenses, calculating quarterly tax payments, and preparing documents can quickly become overwhelming.
