Have you ever been in a situation where you needed a few dollars to buy office supplies, pay for a taxi, or grab coffee for a client meeting, but going through the full company expense process felt like overkill? That’s exactly why petty cash exists.

‍

[Petty cash](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/petty-cash) is a small pool of money businesses keep on hand for minor expenses. While it may sound simple, handling petty cash properly is an important part of bookkeeping and financial control. Even small amounts, if mismanaged, can cause bigger accounting headaches later.

‍

In this guide, we’ll break down what petty cash is, how it works, why businesses use it, and how to manage it effectively. You’ll also see real-world examples and tips to avoid common mistakes.

‍

By the end, you’ll know exactly how petty cash fits into accounting and why it matters for both small businesses and larger organizations.

‍

What Is Petty Cash?
-------------------

‍

Petty cash refers to a small amount of physical money a business sets aside for day-to-day minor expenses. Instead of processing every small purchase through formal accounts payable systems, employees can use petty cash for quick payments.

Think of it as a financial cushion for those “small but necessary” costs.

‍

### Petty Cash Meaning in Accounting

In accounting terms, petty cash is recorded as a current asset on the balance sheet. It sits under “cash and cash equivalents,” alongside bank balances.

‍

### Petty Cash Example

‍

*   Buying postage stamps
*   Reimbursing a taxi ride
*   Coffee and snacks for a team meeting
*   Emergency office supplies like pens or notepads

Even though these amounts are small individually, they add up over time, making proper tracking essential.

‍

Why Do Businesses Use Petty Cash Funds?
---------------------------------------

‍

Businesses use petty cash for convenience and efficiency. Not every expense requires writing a check, processing a credit card, or logging into an online banking platform.

Here are the top reasons:

1.   Saves time – No need to go through long approval cycles for small purchases.
2.   Keeps operations smooth – Covers immediate or emergency needs.
3.   Reduces transaction fees – Some very small purchases aren’t practical via card.
4.   Improves flexibility – Employees don’t always need to use their own money first.

For example, if a delivery driver needs to pay for parking, petty cash ensures they don’t face out-of-pocket costs.

‍

How Much Should a Petty Cash Fund Be?
-------------------------------------

‍

The size of a petty cash fund depends on the business size, type, and frequency of small expenses.

*   Small business: $50–$200
*   Medium business: $200–$500
*   Larger companies: $500–$1,000 or more, split across departments

The key is to keep it enough to cover daily needs without being so large that it becomes a risk for theft or misuse.

‍

Setting Up a Petty Cash Fund
----------------------------

‍

Creating a petty cash fund involves a few structured steps:

1.   Decide the fund amount – Based on expected small expenses.
2.   Appoint a petty cash custodian – Someone responsible for managing the money.
3.   Record the initial fund – Journal entry:
    *   Debit: Petty Cash
    *   Credit: Cash/Bank Account

4.   Store securely – Usually in a locked cash box or drawer.
5.   Define rules – Set limits (e.g., no single purchase above $50).

Having policies ensures accountability and reduces the chance of misuse.

‍

How to Use Petty Cash
---------------------

‍

Using petty cash should follow a voucher-based system to maintain control.

1.   Request approval – Employee explains the need.
2.   Issue cash with a voucher – Custodian gives money and logs details.
3.   Submit receipt – Employee provides receipt after purchase.
4.   Reconcile balance – Cash + receipts must always equal the total fund amount.

‍

### Example

*   Petty cash fund: $200
*   Employee takes $20 for office supplies
*   Returns with a receipt
*   Remaining cash: $180 + $20 receipt = $200

This process prevents accounting discrepancies.

‍

Petty Cash Journal Entries
--------------------------

‍

To keep accounting accurate, petty cash transactions are recorded in the books.

### Initial Setup:

*   Debit: Petty Cash
*   Credit: Bank Account

### Example Transaction: Buying Supplies

*   Debit: Office Supplies
*   Credit: Petty Cash

### Replenishing the Fund

When petty cash runs low, it’s topped up by writing a check or transferring from the main account.

Journal Entry:

*   Debit: Various Expense Accounts
*   Credit: Cash/Bank Account

‍

Advantages of Petty Cash
------------------------

1.   Quick access to funds for emergencies.
2.   Reduces employee burden (no need to front small expenses).
3.   Simplifies small payments without creating unnecessary accounting records.
4.   Efficient for cash-only expenses (e.g., parking meters).

‍

Drawbacks of Petty Cash
-----------------------

While helpful, petty cash has some limitations:

1.   Risk of theft or loss – Physical money is harder to secure.
2.   Tracking challenges – Without strict rules, funds can be misused.
3.   Manual reconciliation – Time-consuming compared to digital payments.
4.   Limited transparency – Harder to monitor than electronic records.

This is why many businesses are moving toward digital petty cash systems or prepaid debit cards.
