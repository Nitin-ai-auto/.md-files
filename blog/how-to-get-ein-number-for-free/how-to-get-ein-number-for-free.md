Starting a business is exciting, you’ve got your idea, maybe even your first customer, and you’re ready to go. But then the paperwork kicks in, and one of the first things you’ll hear about is the EIN (Employer Identification Number).

Here’s the good news: you don’t have to pay a dime to get one. That’s right, your EIN number is 100% free if you apply through the right channels.

What Is an EIN Number?
----------------------

An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS to identify your business for tax purposes. Think of it like a Social Security Number (SSN), but for your company.

It’s also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number.

### Why It Matters:

*   Needed to open a business bank account
*   Required to hire employees legally
*   Used to file business tax returns
*   Necessary when applying for business licenses and permits
*   Often requested by vendors, clients, or lenders

Pro Tip: Even if you’re a sole proprietor with no employees, you may still want an EIN to separate your personal and business finances.

Yes! 100% free.

The IRS does not charge anything to issue an EIN. If you’ve seen websites offering to “get you an EIN” for a fee, those are third-party services adding unnecessary charges.

### Common Misconceptions:

*   My accountant says there’s a fee. Wrong, maybe they’re charging you for filing on your behalf.
*   I need to pay to expedite the process. Wrong, when you apply online, you get your EIN instantly.
*   Foreign businesses must pay. Wrong, non-U.S. entities can also apply for free by phone, fax, or mail.

Bottom line: If you follow the official IRS process, your EIN will cost you nothing.

How to Get an EIN Number Free (Step-by-Step)
--------------------------------------------

Here’s a breakdown of the exact process.

### Step 1: Determine If You Need an EIN

You need an EIN if you:

*   Hire employees
*   Operate as a corporation or partnership
*   File employment, excise, or alcohol/tobacco/firearms tax returns
*   Withhold taxes on income paid to a non-resident alien
*   Run certain types of trusts, estates, or nonprofits

If none of these apply, you may still want one for banking and privacy purposes.

### Step 2: Apply Online Through the IRS Website

The fastest and easiest way is applying online.

*   Go to the IRS EIN Application Page
*   Click “Apply Online Now”
*   Fill out the application (takes about 10 minutes)
*   Once submitted, you’ll receive your EIN immediately

Note: The IRS online system is only available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday–Friday.

### Step 3: Apply by Fax or Mail (If Needed)

If you’re not eligible to apply online (like if you’re an international applicant), you can:

*   Fax: Fill out Form SS-4 and fax it to the IRS. You’ll get your EIN within 4 business days.
*   Mail: Send Form SS-4 to the IRS. Processing takes about 4–6 weeks.

### Step 4: Apply by Phone (For International Applicants)

If you don’t have a U.S. legal residence, you can call the IRS at 267-941-1099 (not toll-free). They’ll walk you through the application and issue an EIN on the spot.

What You’ll Need to Apply
-------------------------

Before you start the application, gather this info:

*   Your legal name (and business name, if different)
*   Mailing address
*   Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
*   Business entity type (sole proprietor, LLC, corporation, partnership, etc.)
*   Reason for applying (new business, banking, hiring employees, etc.)

Having these details ready makes the process smoother.

Why Do People Pay for a Free EIN?
---------------------------------

Despite the IRS making EIN applications free, many business owners still end up paying third-party sites. Why?

*   Lack of awareness: People don’t realize the IRS offers it for free.
*   Convenience: Some prefer outsourcing paperwork.
*   Fear of mistakes: New entrepreneurs worry about filling out forms incorrectly.

If you feel overwhelmed, you can [hire a CPA](https://joinotto.com/cpa-consultation) or service to handle it, but know they’re charging for their time, not the EIN itself.

EIN vs. Tax ID vs. SSN: What’s the Difference?
----------------------------------------------

*   EIN = For businesses
*   Tax ID = General term that includes EIN, SSN, and ITIN
*   SSN = For individuals
*   ITIN = For non-U.S. residents filing taxes

In short: EIN is a type of Tax ID, but not the only one.
