If you run a small business, you’ve probably asked yourself: _How much does payroll really cost me?_ Payroll isn’t just about cutting paychecks, it’s a mix of employee wages, benefits, [taxes](https://joinotto.com/tax), software fees, and sometimes professional services. And here’s the catch: those costs can add up quickly if you’re not careful.

‍

In this guide, we’ll break down everything you need to know about payroll costs, what goes into them, how payroll service providers price their solutions, and how you can keep costs manageable while still paying your employees accurately and on time. Whether you’re running payroll manually, using software, or outsourcing to a service provider, this article will give you a full picture of what to expect.

‍

What Is Payroll?
----------------

‍

Payroll is the process of compensating employees for their work. But it’s more than just writing checks, it involves calculating wages, deducting taxes, managing employee benefits, and ensuring compliance with state and federal labor laws.

‍

For small businesses, payroll can be done in three primary ways:

*   Manual Payroll – Calculating pay and deductions by hand (not recommended, high risk of errors).
*   Payroll Software – Using [accounting software](https://joinotto.com/accounting) to automate calculations.
*   Payroll Services – Outsourcing payroll to a provider that handles everything for you.

The method you choose impacts how much payroll costs.

‍

The True Cost of Payroll
------------------------

‍

So, how much does payroll cost? The answer depends on several factors:

1.   Employee Wages – The largest portion of payroll costs.
2.   Payroll Taxes – Employer-paid Social Security, Medicare, federal and state unemployment taxes.
3.   Benefits – Health insurance, retirement contributions, paid time off.
4.   Payroll Processing Fees – Costs of payroll software or outsourced services.
5.   Hidden Costs – Errors, late tax filings, or compliance penalties.

When you add everything up, payroll isn’t just one flat fee, it’s a combination of direct and indirect costs that small businesses must plan for.

‍

Payroll Services Pricing: What to Expect
----------------------------------------

‍

Many small businesses outsource payroll because it saves time and reduces errors. But how much do payroll services cost?

Here’s a breakdown:

*   Base Fee: $30–$100 per month.
*   Per Employee Fee: $4–$10 per employee, per month.
*   Additional Fees: For things like year-end tax forms (W-2s, 1099s), direct deposit, or garnishments.

For example:

 If you run a company with 10 employees, a payroll provider might charge:

*   $40 base fee + $6 per employee = $100 per month.

That works out to $1,200 annually, just for payroll processing.

‍

Payroll Software Costs
----------------------

‍

If you’d rather handle payroll in-house, payroll software is a more budget-friendly option. But how much does payroll software cost?

Most payroll software charges monthly subscription fees, plus possible add-ons:

*   Basic Plans: $20–$40/month + $4–$6 per employee.
*   Premium Plans: $50–$100/month + $8–$10 per employee (includes HR tools, tax filing, compliance help).

Some well-known payroll software options include:

*   Gusto – Popular with startups and small businesses.
*   QuickBooks Payroll – Great if you already use QuickBooks.
*   ADP Run – Scales well with growing businesses.

Payroll software is usually cheaper than outsourcing but requires you (or your HR team) to be hands-on.

‍

Payroll Service Cost vs. Doing It Yourself
------------------------------------------

‍

So, should you pay for a payroll service or do it yourself with software?

Payroll Service Pros

*   Saves time and effort
*   Ensures compliance with tax laws
*   Reduces risk of costly mistakes

Payroll Service Cons

*   Higher monthly costs
*   Less control over payroll processes

Payroll Software Pros

*   Lower cost than outsourcing
*   More control and flexibility
*   Integrates with accounting systems

Payroll Software Cons

*   Still requires your time and attention
*   Risk of errors if data is entered incorrectly

If your business has fewer than 5 employees, payroll software might be enough. If you’re growing quickly, outsourcing may save you headaches in the long run.

‍

Cost of Payroll Per Employee
----------------------------

‍

One of the most common questions small business owners ask is: _How much should payroll cost per employee?_

On average, payroll processing costs:

*   $20–$30 per employee per month (including software/service fees).
*   Plus, employers typically pay an extra 7.65% in payroll taxes (Social Security & Medicare).
*   Benefits (like healthcare or retirement contributions) can add 20–30% of an employee’s salary.

For example:

 If you pay an employee $3,000/month:

*   Payroll taxes: ~$230
*   Benefits: ~$600–$900
*   Payroll service fee: ~$20–$30

 Total payroll cost: ~$3,850–$3,950

Hidden Payroll Costs Small Businesses Overlook
----------------------------------------------

‍

It’s easy to underestimate payroll costs because many expenses don’t show up immediately. Here are a few hidden costs:

*   Compliance Penalties – Late or incorrect tax filings can cost thousands.
*   Overtime Mismanagement – Failing to track employee hours properly.
*   Employee Turnover – Recruiting and training replacements is expensive.
*   Integration Costs – Adding payroll software to your existing systems.

These hidden costs can quickly make payroll more expensive than expected.
