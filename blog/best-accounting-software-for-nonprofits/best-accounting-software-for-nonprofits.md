Running a nonprofit is rewarding, but it also comes with unique challenges. From tracking donations and managing grants to ensuring compliance with tax laws, financial management can feel overwhelming. Unlike for-profit businesses, nonprofits must prioritize transparency and accountability, every dollar counts, and stakeholders want to see exactly how funds are being used.

That’s where nonprofit accounting software comes in. The right [accounting software](https://joinotto.com/accounting) can help you streamline bookkeeping, manage restricted funds, and generate the reports you need to satisfy your board, donors, and auditors.

In this article, we’ll explore the best accounting software for nonprofits in 2025, compare features, and highlight why Otto AI stands out as a top choice for organizations of all sizes.

Why Nonprofits Need Specialized Accounting Software
---------------------------------------------------

Accounting for nonprofits is very different from small businesses. Here’s why nonprofits can’t just use generic tools without modifications:

*   **Fund accounting –** Nonprofits track money by its purpose (e.g., donations for scholarships vs. general expenses).
*   **Donor transparency –** Reports need to show how funds were allocated.
*   **Grant management –** Many nonprofits juggle multiple grants, each with reporting requirements.
*   **Compliance –**Tax-exempt organizations must file detailed IRS forms (like Form 990 in the U.S.).
*   **Board reporting –**Clear financial statements are essential for governance and oversight.

Without specialized software, nonprofits often find themselves buried in spreadsheets, risking errors and inefficiencies.
