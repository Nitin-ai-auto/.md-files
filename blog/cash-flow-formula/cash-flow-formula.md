Cash is the lifeblood of any business. You could have record sales, but if money isn’t moving in and out the right way, you’ll quickly run into trouble. In fact, poor [cash flow management](https://joinotto.com/cash-flow) is one of the top reasons small businesses fail.

Here’s the good news: learning how to calculate cash flow isn’t as complicated as it sounds. Once you understand the cash flow formula and apply it step by step, you’ll have a clear picture of whether your business is truly healthy, or if you need to make adjustments before problems snowball.

‍

What Is Cash Flow?
------------------

Before we dive into the formula for cash flow, let’s define what we’re talking about.

At its simplest, cash flow is the movement of money into and out of your business over a certain period of time.

*   Cash inflows: Money coming in (sales, investments, loans, etc.)
*   Cash outflows: Money going out (expenses, salaries, rent, loan repayments, etc.)

If more money comes in than goes out, you have positive cash flow. That means your business can cover expenses, reinvest, and grow.

If more money goes out than comes in, you have negative cash flow. This doesn’t always mean disaster, sometimes businesses spend heavily upfront before revenue kicks in but it’s a warning sign to watch.

Think of cash flow like your personal bank account. Even if you earn a good salary, if your bills and credit card payments eat up more than you bring in, you’ll quickly feel the squeeze.

‍

Why Cash Flow Matters
---------------------

Understanding and tracking cash flow is critical for several reasons:

*   Survival: Without enough cash on hand, you can’t pay employees, suppliers, or rent, even if profits look good on paper.
*   Planning: Cash flow forecasting helps you prepare for slow seasons or big investments.
*   Growth: Positive cash flow gives you room to expand, hire, and scale.
*   Funding: Banks and investors look closely at cash flow before approving loans or capital.

In short: profits don’t pay the bills, cash flow does.

There isn’t just one cash flow formula, it depends on what kind of cash flow you’re measuring. Let’s look at the most common ones.

**1. Net Cash Flow Formula**

The simplest way to calculate overall cash flow is:

Net Cash Flow = Cash Inflows – Cash Outflows

This tells you the net amount of cash your business gained or lost over a period.

‍

**2. Cash Flow from Operations Formula**

When you want to know how much cash your _core business activities_ generate (not loans or investments), use the cash flow from operations formula:

Cash Flow from Operations = Operating Cash Inflows – Operating Cash Outflows

This excludes financing and investing activities, focusing only on daily operations.

‍

**3. Indirect Cash Flow Formula (from Net Income)**

Another common method starts with your net income from the income statement and adjusts for non-cash items and changes in working capital:

Cash Flow from Operations = Net Income + Non-Cash Expenses + Changes in Working Capital

‍

Step-by-Step: How to Calculate Cash Flow
----------------------------------------

Now let’s walk through how to calculate cash flow step by step.

### Step 1: Gather Your Financial Statements

To calculate cash flow, you’ll need:

*   [Income statement](https://joinotto.com/templates/income-statement) (profit & loss statement)
*   [Balance sheet](https://joinotto.com/templates/balance-sheet) (to track changes in assets and liabilities)
*   [Cash flow statement](https://joinotto.com/templates/cash-flow-statement) (if already available, to cross-check)

If you’re using [AI Accounting Software](https://joinotto.com/accounting), these reports are usually generated automatically.

### Step 2: Choose the Method

You can calculate cash flow using two main methods:

*   Direct method: Add up actual cash inflows and outflows from operating activities.
*   Indirect method: Start with net income, then adjust for non-cash items (like depreciation) and changes in working capital.

Most businesses use the indirect method, since it links directly to the income statement and balance sheet.

‍

### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow from Operations

Using the indirect method:

1.   Start with Net Income (from the income statement).
2.   Add back Non-Cash Expenses like depreciation and amortization.
3.   Adjust for Changes in Working Capital:
    *   Increase in accounts receivable = subtract (less cash collected).
    *   Increase in accounts payable = add (you delayed payments, keeping cash).
    *   Increase in inventory = subtract (cash tied up in stock).

Example:

*   Net Income: $50,000
*   Depreciation: $10,000
*   Accounts Receivable increased by $5,000
*   Accounts Payable increased by $7,000
*   Inventory increased by $3,000

Cash Flow from Operations = 50,000 + 10,000 – 5,000 + 7,000 – 3,000 = $59,000

‍

### Step 4: Add Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Next, consider money spent or earned from investments:

*   Buying equipment or property = cash outflow
*   Selling assets or investments = cash inflow

### Step 5: Add Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Finally, add flows from financing:

*   Loans received = inflow
*   Loan repayments = outflow
*   Issuing stock = inflow
*   Dividends paid = outflow

### Step 6: Combine for Net Cash Flow

Total all three categories:

Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investing + Financing

This gives you the complete picture of how much cash your business gained or lost in the period.

Real-World Example: Café Cash Flow
----------------------------------

Let’s bring this to life with a small business example.

Maria runs a coffee shop. Here’s her financial snapshot for the year:

*   Net Income: $70,000
*   Depreciation: $8,000
*   Accounts Receivable increased by $4,000
*   Accounts Payable increased by $6,000
*   Inventory increased by $5,000
*   Bought new espresso machine: $12,000
*   Took out a small loan: $20,000
*   Repaid $5,000 of the loan

Step 1: Cash Flow from Operations

 70,000 + 8,000 – 4,000 + 6,000 – 5,000 = $75,000

‍

Step 2: Cash Flow from Investing

 –12,000 (espresso machine purchase)

‍

Step 3: Cash Flow from Financing

 +20,000 (loan received) – 5,000 (loan repayment) = +15,000

‍

Step 4: Net Cash Flow

 75,000 – 12,000 + 15,000 = $78,000

‍

Even though Maria spent heavily on equipment, her financing activities and strong operations kept her cash flow positive.

Common Mistakes When Calculating Cash Flow
------------------------------------------

Even with the right cash flow formula, business owners often stumble. Here are pitfalls to avoid:

*   Confusing profit with cash flow: Just because you’re profitable doesn’t mean you have cash on hand.
*   Forgetting non-cash expenses: Depreciation and amortization reduce profit but don’t affect cash.
*   Ignoring working capital changes: Customers who haven’t paid yet (AR) can make you look cash-rich when you’re not.
*   Not separating personal and business finances: Mixing the two makes cash flow tracking a nightmare.

How to Improve Cash Flow Once You’ve Calculated It
--------------------------------------------------

Calculating is just the start. Once you see where you stand, here are some ways to improve:

*   Invoice faster: Send invoices immediately and set clear payment terms.
*   Offer payment incentives: Discounts for early payments encourage customers to pay sooner.
*   Negotiate with suppliers: Longer payment terms can ease short-term cash crunches.
*   Cut unnecessary expenses: Review subscriptions, rent, or inventory levels.
*   Use financing wisely: A line of credit can help smooth out seasonal dips.

Cash Flow Formula Recap
-----------------------

Here are the key formulas for cash flow at a glance:

*   Net Cash Flow Formula:

Cash Inflows – Cash Outflows
*   Cash Flow from Operations Formula (Indirect):

Net Income + Non-Cash Expenses + Changes in Working Capital
*   Total Cash Flow:

Operating Cash Flow + Investing Cash Flow + Financing Cash Flow

These formulas work together to give you the full financial picture.

Key Takeaways
-------------
