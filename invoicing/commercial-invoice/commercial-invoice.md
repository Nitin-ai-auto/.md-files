What is a Commercial Invoice?
-----------------------------

A commercial invoice is a document that businesses use to bill customers for goods or services. It's an important part of the sales process, especially for international transactions. Imagine you run a small business selling handmade jewelry online. When a customer orders a bracelet, a commercial invoice is created to detail the sale.

What information is included on a Commercial Invoice?
-----------------------------------------------------

A commercial invoice typically includes several key pieces of information:

*   The seller's name and address.
*   The buyer's name and address.
*   A description of the goods or services provided.
*   The quantity and price of each item.
*   The total amount due (or [gross amount](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/gross-amount)).
*   The [invoice date](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/invoice-date) and [invoice number](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/invoice-number).

For instance, if your jewelry business sold 5 bracelets at $20 each, the invoice would list each bracelet, its price, and the total of $100.

Why is a Commercial Invoice important?
--------------------------------------

Commercial invoices serve multiple purposes:

*   They provide proof of the sale for both the seller and the buyer.
*   They are often required for customs clearance when shipping internationally.
*   They help in keeping accurate financial records for tax purposes.

For small businesses, keeping track of these documents is vital for managing finances and ensuring compliance with laws.

How does a Commercial Invoice help small businesses?
----------------------------------------------------

For creators and small business owners, having a clear and professional commercial invoice can help build credibility. It shows customers that you are organized and serious about your business. For example, if you sell online courses, a well-prepared invoice for each course can help customers feel confident in their purchase.
