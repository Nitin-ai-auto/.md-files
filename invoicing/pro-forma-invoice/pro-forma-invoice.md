A Pro Forma Invoice is a preliminary document that outlines the details of a potential sale. It is not an official bill but serves as a quote or an estimated invoice for the buyer. This type of invoice may include the description of goods or services, prices, quantities, and any additional costs such as shipping and taxes.
