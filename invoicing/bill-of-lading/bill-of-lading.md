What is a Bill of Lading?
-------------------------

A Bill of Lading (BOL) is a crucial document used in the shipping industry. It serves as a receipt for goods that have been shipped and outlines the details of the cargo being transported. When you send or receive a package, a Bill of Lading helps to track the shipment and provides important information about the contents, the sender, and the recipient.

What are the main purposes of a Bill of Lading?

The Bill of Lading has three main purposes:

*   Receipt: It confirms that the carrier has received the cargo in good condition.
*   Contract: It acts as a contract between the shipper and the carrier detailing the transportation terms.
*   Title: It serves as a document of title, which means it can be transferred to others, giving them ownership rights to the goods.

How does a Bill of Lading work in shipping?

When a seller ships goods to a buyer, they prepare a Bill of Lading. Here’s how it typically works:

1.   The seller (shipper) contacts a shipping company and provides details about the shipment.
2.   The shipping company prepares the Bill of Lading, which includes details like the type of goods, quantity, and destination.
3.   The shipper receives the Bill of Lading as proof that the shipping company has accepted the goods for transportation.
4.   Once the goods reach the destination, the buyer presents the Bill of Lading to claim the shipment.
