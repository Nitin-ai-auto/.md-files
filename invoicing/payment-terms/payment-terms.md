What are Payment Terms?
-----------------------

Payment terms are the conditions under which a buyer agrees to pay a seller for goods or services provided. These terms help both parties understand when payment is due and what methods of payment are accepted. For small business owners, especially those in creative fields, clear payment terms can help manage cash flow and set expectations with clients.

Why are Payment Terms Important?
--------------------------------

Having clear payment terms is crucial for several reasons:

*   They prevent misunderstandings between you and your clients regarding when payments are expected.
*   They help you maintain a steady cash flow, which is essential for running your business.
*   They establish a professional image, showing clients that you are organized and serious about your work.

What are Common Payment Terms for Creatives?
--------------------------------------------

Some common payment terms you might encounter or use include:

*   Net 30: Payment is due 30 days after the invoice date.
*   50% upfront: Clients pay half the total cost before work begins and the remaining half upon completion.
*   Due on receipt: Full payment is expected immediately upon delivery of the invoice.

How Can You Set Up Your Payment Terms?
--------------------------------------

To create your own payment terms, consider the following steps:

*   Assess your business needs: Understand how much cash flow you need to operate and what works for your project timelines.
*   Be clear and concise: Write down your terms and make sure clients understand them. Include them in your contracts and invoices.
*   Communicate openly: Discuss payment terms with your clients before starting a project to ensure everyone is on the same page.

What Should You Do if a Client Doesn't Pay?
-------------------------------------------

If a client misses a payment, consider these actions:
