What is a Purchase Order?
-------------------------

A Purchase Order (PO) is a document that a buyer sends to a seller to request goods or services. It acts as a formal agreement between the two parties. When a business wants to buy items, it creates a purchase order that includes details like the type of items, quantity, price, and [due date](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/due-date). This document helps ensure that both the buyer and seller understand what is being ordered and the [payment terms](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/payment-terms) of the sale.

Why is a Purchase Order Important?
----------------------------------

Purchase orders are important for several reasons:

*   They provide a clear record of what was ordered, which helps prevent misunderstandings.
*   They help businesses manage their budget by keeping track of expenditures.
*   They serve as a legal document that can protect the buyer if there are disputes about the order.

A PO can also be useful when managing [partial payments](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/partial-payment) or handling an [advance payment](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/advance-payment) before the order is fulfilled.

How Does a Purchase Order Work?
-------------------------------

The process of using a purchase order usually involves several steps:

1.   The buyer identifies the need for goods or services.
2.   The buyer creates a purchase order, detailing the order specifics.
3.   The buyer sends the purchase order to the seller.
4.   The seller reviews the order, confirms it, and may send an invoice later.
5.   Once the goods are delivered, the buyer checks them against the purchase order.

If discrepancies arise, the buyer and seller may use a [credit note](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/credit-note) to adjust the transaction.

What Should Be Included in a Purchase Order?
--------------------------------------------

When creating a purchase order, it’s important to include the following details:

*   Name and contact information of both the buyer and seller.
*   Purchase order number for tracking.
*   Description of the goods or services being ordered.
*   Quantity and price of each item.
*   Delivery date and terms of payment.

Can Creatives Use Purchase Orders?
----------------------------------

Absolutely! Creatives, like artists and graphic designers, can use purchase orders when they need to order supplies or hire services. For example:

*   An artist may create a PO to order canvases and paint from a supplier.
*   A designer could use a purchase order to hire a freelancer for a specific project.

Using purchase orders helps them stay organized and ensures they keep track of their expenses, which is essential for managing their budgets effectively.
