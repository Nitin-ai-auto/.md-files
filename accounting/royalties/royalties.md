**What Are Royalties?**
-----------------------

**‍**Royalties refer to payments made to creators for the ongoing use of their work or intellectual property. For creators such as podcasters, filmmakers, musicians, visual artists, video editors, and other content producers, royalties are a way to earn passive income from their creations long after they’ve been produced. To collect these payments efficiently, creators often need to [send invoices to clients](https://joinotto.com/invoicing) or platforms distributing their content. These payments are typically made based on the sale, broadcast, or distribution of the creator's content, providing a continuous revenue stream.

**How Do Royalties Work?**
--------------------------

**‍**Understanding how royalties work is essential for creators to maximize their earnings. When someone uses your creative work—whether it's a song, a podcast, a film, or even a photograph—you can receive royalties as compensation. The payment amount usually depends on how your work is used, such as how many times it’s downloaded, streamed, sold, or broadcast. For example, a musician might earn royalties when their song is played on the radio, while a filmmaker may receive royalties each time their film is rented or purchased.

**Different Types of Royalties**
--------------------------------

**‍**Creators can earn royalties through different types of agreements. Some of the most common include:

*   **Performance Royalties**: For musicians, performers, and composers, performance royalties are earned when their music is played in public spaces like clubs, concerts, or even on streaming platforms.
*   **Mechanical Royalties**: These are earned when a song or music track is reproduced, such as in physical copies (like CDs) or digital formats (like downloads).
*   **Royalty from Licensing**: If a creator allows their work to be used in a commercial setting—like a photograph in an advertisement or a clip in a documentary—they earn royalties through [licensing agreements](https://joinotto.com/contract/content-licensing-agreement).
*   **Royalty from Sales**: For podcasters or authors, royalties can also be earned from the sale of books, audiobooks, or podcast episodes. This payment is typically a percentage of the sale price.

Each of these types of royalties allows creators to continue earning from their work as it’s shared, sold, or used in various formats.

### **How Are Royalties Calculated?**

**‍**Royalties are generally calculated based on a percentage of the [revenue](https://joinotto.com/accounting/revenue) generated from the use of your work. For example, a musician might receive 10% of the revenue generated by streaming platforms each time their song is played. Here's a basic formula for how royalties work:

*   **Royalties Earned = Revenue from Usage x Royalty Rate**

For instance, if a song generates $1,000 from streaming and the royalty rate is 10%, the creator would earn $100 in royalties.

Let’s consider an example for a wedding photographer:

If a photographer sells a package that includes a set of photos for $500, and they’ve agreed to a 20% royalty on each sale of their images to an online stock photography service, they would earn $100 each time their photos are sold. To set profitable royalty rates, photographers should also consider their [production cost](https://joinotto.com/accounting/production-costs) when pricing packages.

Creators in fields like music, photography, video production, or even fitness content can all benefit from royalties. Podcasters might receive royalties from ads played during their shows, or filmmakers could receive them for each DVD or streaming download of their movie.

##### **Royalties Examples**

1.   **Podcasters**: A podcaster may receive a percentage of the ad revenue generated by their episodes or subscriptions from listeners.
2.   **Musicians**: A musician can receive performance royalties every time their song is streamed or played publicly.
3.   **Photographers**: Wedding or e-commerce photographers can earn royalties from images licensed to websites, businesses, or print publications.

By understanding royalties and how they’re calculated, creative professionals can better [manage their income streams](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping) and ensure they’re compensated for the ongoing use of their work.
