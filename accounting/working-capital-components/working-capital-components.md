Components Of Working Capital
=============================

What are the Components of Working Capital?
-------------------------------------------

Working capital is the money a business uses to run its day-to-day operations. It’s really important because it helps a company manage its short-term financial needs. The components of working capital include [current assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/current-assets) and current liabilities. Current assets are things the company owns that can quickly be turned into [cash](https://joinotto.com/accounting/cash-book), while current liabilities are what the company owes that need to be paid off soon.

### What are Current Assets?

Current assets are valuable resources that a business can convert into cash within a year. Examples of current assets include:

*   **Cash:** The money the business has on hand.
*   **Accounts Receivable:** Money owed to the business by customers who bought products on credit.
*   **Inventory:** Products that are ready to be sold to customers.

These assets are crucial for maintaining daily operations and ensuring that the business can meet its obligations.

### What are Current Liabilities?

Current liabilities are debts a business needs to pay off within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include:

*   **Accounts Payable:** Money the business owes to suppliers for goods and services received.
*   **Short-term Loans:** Loans that need to be repaid within a year.
*   **Accrued Expenses:** Bills that have been incurred but not yet paid, like utilities or salaries.

Understanding both current assets and current liabilities helps a business ensure it has enough funds to operate without any financial hiccups.

### How to Calculate Working Capital?

To figure out working capital, you can use a simple formula:

**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**

For example, if a business has $50,000 in current assets and $30,000 in current liabilities, the [working capital](https://joinotto.com/accounting) would be:

**$50,000 - $30,000 = $20,000**

This means the business has $20,000 available to cover its [short-term needs](https://joinotto.com/accounting/net-operating-income), which is a good sign of financial health.
