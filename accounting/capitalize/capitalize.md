Capitalize
==========

What Does It Mean to Capitalize?
--------------------------------

In accounting, to capitalize means to record a cost as an asset instead of an expense. This is important because assets have long-term value, while expenses are costs that are used up quickly. For example, when a small business buys a new computer for $1,000, they can capitalize that purchase. Instead of showing it as an expense right away, they spread out the cost over several years as the computer is used.

Why is Capitalizing Important?
------------------------------

Capitalizing expenses helps businesses reflect their financial health accurately. Here are a few reasons why it matters:

*   It helps show a more realistic profit on financial statements.
*   It allows businesses to balance their budgets more effectively.
*   Investors and lenders often look at the balance sheet to understand a company's value.

How Do You Capitalize an Asset?
-------------------------------

To capitalize an asset, follow these basic steps:

*   Identify the purchase that should be capitalized (like equipment or buildings).
*   Determine the useful life of the asset (how long you can use it).
*   Divide the cost of the asset over its useful life in your financial records.

For example, if you buy a machine for $10,000 and expect it to last 5 years, you would record $2,000 as an expense each year.

What Happens When You Don’t Capitalize?
---------------------------------------

If a business fails to capitalize an asset, it could misrepresent its financial situation. The profits shown might be lower than they actually are, which can affect decisions made by investors or banks.

Can You Give an Example?
------------------------

Sure! Let’s say you're a creator who buys a high-quality camera for your YouTube channel for $2,500. Instead of recording the full amount as an expense in the month you buy it, you would capitalize the camera. If you plan to use it for 5 years, you would list it as an asset and record $500 as an expense each year. This way, your financial records will show a clearer picture of your business's profitability over time.
