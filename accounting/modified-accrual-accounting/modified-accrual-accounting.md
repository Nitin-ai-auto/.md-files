Modified Accrual Accounting
===========================

**What Is Modified Accrual Accounting?**
----------------------------------------

Modified accrual accounting combines elements of both cash and [accrual accounting](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/accrual-accounting). Used primarily in government accounting, this method allows for a flexible approach in recording revenue and expenses, making it a practical choice for creative professionals, such as podcasters, visual artists, and musicians, who may have varying revenue cycles. In modified accrual accounting, revenues are recorded when they become available and measurable, while expenditures are noted when the relevant obligations occur, offering creative professionals a straightforward way to manage short- and long-term financial commitments without strictly adhering to the accrual or cash basis.

**Basic Rules of Modified Accrual Accounting**
----------------------------------------------

Modified accrual accounting operates on a few basic principles that bridge cash and accrual methods. For creative professionals, these rules mean recognizing income when it is reasonably assured of receipt and recording expenses when they are due. For instance, if a creative professional has a contract payment due in 30 days, the income is recorded only when it is available to them. This approach keeps financial records close to cash flow reality while meeting obligations.

### **Modified Accrual Accounting When Recording Short-Term Events**

When creative professionals record short-term transactions—such as receiving payments for project work or covering equipment rental expenses—modified accrual accounting treats these as near-immediate entries, similar to the cash basis. For example, a filmmaker using modified accrual basis accounting records a [deposit payment](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/deposit-invoice) for an upcoming video project as soon as the payment is available. Short-term entries enable creative professionals to keep cash flow in focus and promptly address financial updates as money comes in or goes out.

### **Modified Accrual Accounting When Recording Long-Term Events**

For long-term obligations, modified accrual accounting takes a different approach by using an accrual-basis framework. This feature is particularly helpful for creative professionals managing significant project-related expenses over multiple fiscal periods. A photographer who buys new equipment on a payment plan, for example, would use the modified accrual basis to record the equipment as a [long-term asset](https://joinotto.com/accounting/asset). As each installment is paid, the obligation gradually reduces, offering a balanced picture of long-term investments against [current assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/current-assets) and [liabilities](https://joinotto.com/accounting/long-term-liabilities).

### **Governmental Modified Accrual Accounting**

The modified accrual basis of accounting is commonly adopted by government entities, as it meets the need for transparency in public finance while adapting to non-commercial revenue streams. Although it may be less common among creative professionals, this basis serves as a valuable example for artists who work with government-funded contracts or grants. By applying modified accrual principles, creative professionals can track grants or stipends as income only once funds are authorized and available, simplifying the financial picture while honoring government accounting standards.

**How Does Modified Accrual Work?**
-----------------------------------

Modified accrual accounting follows a blend of methods for recording transactions. Short-term assets and liabilities follow the cash basis, recognizing [revenue](https://joinotto.com/accounting/revenue) and expenses only when cash changes hands. For longer-term transactions, the accrual method prevails, allowing expenses to be recognized as they are incurred, even if payment is made later. For example, a designer using the modified accrual basis may record income from a multi-stage project once each payment phase is accessible, aligning income with project progress rather than when cash is received in full.

### **The Benefit of Modified Accrual Accounting**

For creative professionals, modified accrual accounting can provide clarity in managing various income and expense types. This basis helps balance immediate cash flow needs with long-term obligations, reducing the need for frequent adjustments that might arise with strict cash or accrual methods. Musicians, for instance, gain flexibility when payments are delayed or tied to specific project milestones. By applying modified accrual accounting principles, they can better align financial records with their project timelines, creating a practical overview of available funds and outstanding commitments.
