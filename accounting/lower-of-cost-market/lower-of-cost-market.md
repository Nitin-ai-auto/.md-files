**What is the Lower of Cost or Market?**
----------------------------------------

The Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) is an accounting principle that states that inventory should be recorded at the lower value between its historical cost and its current market value. This ensures that the value of inventory on the balance sheet does not exceed what it can realistically be sold for, reflecting a more accurate financial position of a business.

**Why is the Lower of Cost or Market important?**
-------------------------------------------------

This principle is essential for businesses to avoid overstating their [assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/asset). It helps provide a conservative view of the company's financial health. Here are some key points:

*   Reflects real value: By using the lower value, companies ensure they are not misrepresenting their inventory's worth.
*   Prevents losses: If the market value drops below cost, applying LCM helps recognize a loss earlier.
*   Financial reporting: It leads to more accurate [financial statements](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/income-statement), which are vital for stakeholders.

**How does Lower of Cost or Market work?**
------------------------------------------

To apply LCM, businesses typically compare the cost of their inventory to its market value. For example, if a small business sells handmade crafts and the cost to produce a craft is $10, but the [market value](https://joinotto.com/tax/fair-market-value) has dropped to $7, the inventory should be recorded at $7. Here’s a simple formula:

**Lower of Cost or Market = Min(Cost, Market Value)**

**Can you give an example of Lower of Cost or Market?**
-------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you own a store that sells art supplies. You bought a batch of paint for $5 per bottle. If the current market demand decreases and the market value drops to $3 per bottle, you would apply LCM. Even though you paid $5, you would record the value of the paint at $3 in your financial records.

**How does this principle affect small businesses?**
----------------------------------------------------

For creative professional-led small businesses, applying the Lower of Cost or Market can help manage inventory efficiently. Here’s how:

*   Better decision-making: Understanding inventory value aids in pricing and purchasing decisions.
*   Easier tax preparation: Accurate inventory valuation helps in correctly reporting taxes.
*   Improved financial health: By recognizing losses early, businesses can make necessary adjustments to stay profitable.
