**What Is Net Operating Income (NOI)?**
---------------------------------------

Net Operating Income (NOI) is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a business or investment property before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. For creative professionals such as podcasters, filmmakers, and photographers, NOI represents the income generated by the core activities of the business, helping you understand the true operational profitability. In simple terms, NOI shows how much money your creative business is earning from its ongoing operations.

**Net Operating Income (NOI) Formula & Calculation**

The formula to calculate Net Operating Income (NOI) is straightforward:

**NOI = Total Revenue – Operating Expenses**

Where:

*   [Total Revenue](https://joinotto.com/accounting/revenue) refers to the income generated from your creative work (e.g., podcast subscriptions, book sales, project fees, or gallery earnings).
*   [Operating Expenses](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/operating-expense) include costs related to running your creative business, such as software subscriptions, office supplies, marketing, or travel for gigs.

Understanding the net operating income formula helps creative professionals track the profitability of their work without getting distracted by non-operating factors like taxes or long-term debt.

**What’s Not Included in Net Operating Income**
-----------------------------------------------

While calculating NOI is crucial for assessing your business's operational health, it’s important to note what is excluded from the calculation. The following are not factored into the net operating income:

*   **Income Taxes:** Taxes on your earnings do not influence your operational income. Taxes come into play after calculating your NOI.
*   **Depreciation:** Depreciation, which accounts for the reduction in value of your [assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/asset) (like cameras or computers), is excluded from NOI as it’s a non-cash expense.
*   **Debt:** Interest expenses on loans or credit lines are not considered in NOI. This ensures that the calculation focuses solely on operating performance.
*   **Tenant Improvements:** If you're renting space or a studio, expenses related to renovating or improving that space are excluded from NOI.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Investments in long-term assets, like new equipment or large-scale renovations, are not part of NOI as they are considered investments rather than operating costs.

**Example of Net Operating Income (NOI)**

To help you understand how to calculate NOI for your creative business, let’s consider an example:

Suppose you are a photographer, and in a month, you earn $5,000 from client projects and sell $1,000 worth of prints, giving you a total revenue of $6,000. Your operating expenses for the month are:

*   Photography gear rental: $300
*   Software subscriptions for editing: $100
*   Marketing costs: $200
*   Travel expenses: $150

Your total operating expenses would be $750. Using the NOI formula:

**NOI = $6,000 (Total Revenue) – $750 (Operating Expenses) = $5,250**

So, your Net Operating Income for the month would be $5,250.

Understanding how to calculate NOI is essential for creative professionals looking to evaluate the financial success of their work. By subtracting your [operating expenses](https://joinotto.com/accounting/operating-cost) from total revenue, you can get a clear picture of how well your business is performing from its core operations. Whether you're a musician managing album sales or a designer offering consulting, knowing your NOI allows you to make informed decisions about reinvestment or growth.
