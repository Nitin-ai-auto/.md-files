**What is Tax Accounting?**
---------------------------

Tax accounting focuses on preparing, analyzing, and presenting taxes in a way that aligns with legal requirements. While financial accounting typically provides a broad picture of income, expenses, and [assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/asset), tax accounting is specifically concerned with meeting taxation obligations. For creative professionals, tax accounting helps organize earnings, separate business from personal expenses, and navigate the complexities of tax codes.

Tax accounting basics for creative professionals include tracking income from various sources, noting allowable deductions, and understanding tax rates. A few core practices involve:

Knowing the types of tax accounting that apply to your work can make it easier to maintain accurate records and comply with tax obligations.

### **Tax Accounting Examples**

Consider these tax accounting examples for different creative professional types:

*   **Podcaster:** A podcaster earns $40,000 annually from various platforms and sponsorships. They spent $5,000 on recording equipment and marketing, which they can deduct, reducing taxable income to $35,000.
