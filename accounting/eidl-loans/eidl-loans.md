What are Economic Injury Disaster Loans?
----------------------------------------

Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are federal loans provided to small businesses and non-profit organizations to help them recover from the financial impact of disasters. These loans are especially useful during times of crisis, such as natural disasters or economic downturns. They are designed to cover operating expenses that cannot be paid because of the disaster's impact on the business. The goal is to provide assistance so businesses can continue their operations and eventually return to normal.

*   **Small Businesses**: These are companies with a limited number of employees and modest revenue.
*   **Non-Profit Organizations**: Groups that operate without profit motives, such as charities and community organizations.
*   **Agricultural Cooperatives**: Businesses that work together to sell agricultural products.

To qualify, businesses must demonstrate that they suffered substantial economic injury due to the disaster.

### What Can EIDL Funds Be Used For?

EIDL funds can be used for various essential business expenses, including:

*   **Payroll Costs**: Paying employees to ensure they remain employed.
*   **Rent or Mortgage Payments**: Covering the cost of your business location.
*   **Utilities**: Paying for services like electricity, water, and internet.
*   **Other Operating Expenses**: General business expenses that are necessary for operations.

It’s important for businesses to use these funds wisely to ensure they can recover fully after a disaster.

### How to Apply for an EIDL?

Applying for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan involves a few steps:

1.   **Determine Eligibility**: Check if your business qualifies based on the disaster's impact.
