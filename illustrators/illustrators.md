Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for illustrators — focus on your art, not overdue invoices, confusing tax forms, or the chaos of tracking freelance payments.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Start Your Illustration Business With Structure
-----------------------------------------------

Otto AI helps illustrators form an LLC or S-Corp quickly. Gain legal protection, simplify your tax structure, and level up your professionalism when clients ask for a business name and not a PayPal link.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Brushes, Apps, and Art Supplies

Invoicing That Speaks the Language of Commissions and Licensing
---------------------------------------------------------------

Charge for sketches, drafts, final artwork, licensing rights, revisions, and rush fees. Otto AI helps you send detailed, branded invoices that reflect the full value of your work—no more chasing payments for 'just a quick sketch.'
