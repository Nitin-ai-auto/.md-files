What is a Referral Agreement?
-----------------------------

A Referral Agreement is a type of [contract](https://joinotto.com/contract-resources/what-is-a-contract) that outlines how one party (the referrer) will refer clients or customers to another party (the recipient) in exchange for payment or commission. This agreement is crucial for creative entrepreneurs like photographers, designers, and coaches to formalize their referral process and ensure everyone understands their rights and responsibilities.

Why Do I Need a Referral Agreement?
-----------------------------------

Having a Referral Agreement is essential for several reasons:

*   **Clarity:** It makes clear what is expected from both parties. For example, if you, as a designer, are referring a potential client to a photographer, the agreement will specify how much you will earn from that referral.
*   **Protection:** It protects both parties if something goes wrong. Without an agreement, misunderstandings can lead to disputes.
*   **Professionalism:** A written agreement shows that you are serious about your business and helps build trust with the other party.

What Should Be Included in a Referral Agreement?
------------------------------------------------

A good Referral Agreement should cover several key points:

*   **Details of the Referral:** Clearly define what a referral means in the context of your agreement. Is it a phone call, an email introduction, or something else?
*   **Compensation Structure:** Outline how much the referrer will earn for each successful referral. For instance, you might agree to receive 10% of the total project cost.
*   **Duration of the Agreement:** Specify how long the agreement will last. This could be a set period or until one party decides to end it with notice.
*   [**Confidentiality Clause**](https://joinotto.com/contract-resources/what-is-confidentiality-clause)**:** If necessary, include a section that ensures both parties keep sensitive information private.

How to Create a Referral Agreement?
-----------------------------------

Creating a Referral Agreement is quite simple. Here’s a formula to follow:

1.   Start with the title and date of the agreement.
2.   Identify both parties involved, including names and contact details.
3.   Define the referral process, including the [scope of work](https://joinotto.com/contract-resources/what-is-scope-of-work) and how referrals will be made.
4.   Detail the compensation structure, including payment terms.
5.   Include clauses about confidentiality and the duration of the agreement.
6.   End with a section for signatures to make it official.

For example, if you are a coach referring clients to a marketing consultant, your agreement might specify that for every client you refer who signs up for a service, you receive a cash bonus of $100. This clarity helps both parties understand their roles and encourages successful referrals.
