The Profit and Loss format is a financial statement that summarizes a business's revenues, expenses, and profits or losses over a specific period. It outlines the income earned from sales and subtracts the costs associated with running the business, such as operational expenses and production costs. The resulting figure represents either a net profit if positive or a loss if negative, helping business owners understand their financial performance.
