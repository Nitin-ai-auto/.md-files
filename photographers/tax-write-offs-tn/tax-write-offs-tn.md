Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Equipment Purchases & Depreciation

You can fully deduct cameras, lenses, computers, and software using Section 179 (up to $1.22M federally for 2024) or depreciate them over time. For items under $2,500, use de minimis expensing. TN conforms to Section 179 and now honors bonus depreciation for post-2023 assets. Maintain Form 4562 and receipts.

$

Equipment Repairs & Maintenance

Routine maintenance, repairs, calibration, and cleaning supplies are deductible. No cap on cost. TN treats these the same—just ensure business relevance. Sales tax on repair parts is also deductible as part of the repair expense.

$

Equipment Rentals

Temporary rentals (camera bodies, lights, etc.) are 100% deductible. Lease-to-own may need to be capitalized. TN follows federal rules. Sales tax on rentals is included in the deduction. Out-of-state rentals may trigger TN use tax.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance
-----------------------------------------

Deductions for studio/office rent, utilities & insurances

Studio or Office Rent & Utilities

Rent for a studio, office, or co-working space is fully deductible, including utilities (electricity, internet, trash, etc.). Space must be used exclusively for business. TN does not tax rent and allows full deduction on the excise tax return. Shared utilities must be prorated; retain lease and bills as proof.

$

Home Office (Business Use of Home)

A portion of home expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, etc.) is deductible if used exclusively and regularly for business. Use either the regular (square footage-based) or simplified ($5/sq ft up to $1,500) method. TN has no personal income tax, so this only impacts federal and possibly TN excise tax.

$

Office Supplies, Software & Expenses

Deduct items like printer ink, stationery, shipping costs, Adobe CC, gallery services, cloud storage, and office phone bills. Shared internet/phone costs should be prorated. TN allows full deduction. Sales tax on digital tools or SaaS is also deductible. Keep itemized receipts or payment history for validation.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel & transportation

Vehicle Use (Mileage & Auto Expenses)

Business driving is deductible using either the IRS standard mileage rate or actual expenses. Track purpose, miles, and dates in a log. You can also deduct tolls, parking, and a business share of insurance or registration fees.

$

Travel – Lodging, Airfare, Meals

Out-of-town business trips qualify for deductions including airfare, hotel, taxi or rental car, baggage fees, and 50% of meals. Keep all receipts and document business purpose clearly. Only the business portion of mixed trips is deductible.

$

Local Transportation & Day Trips

Uber, taxis, public transit, and parking fees for local work travel are fully deductible. Even if you use mileage for your car, you can separately deduct these transit costs. Maintain digital or paper receipts to back up expenses.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors & assistants

Contracted Photographers & Assistants

Payments to second shooters, freelance editors, or assistants are 100% deductible as contract labor. If you pay $600+ to a U.S. contractor, you must file Form 1099-NEC. Keep W-9 forms and proof of payments. TN mirrors federal rules—no personal income tax, but for LLCs, this lowers excise tax liability.

$

Referral Fees & Commissions

Paying a referral fee (e.g., to a planner for client leads) or sales commission is deductible. Issue 1099-NEC for any individual paid $600+ yearly. Keep records for all payments. TN allows full deduction; commissions do not reduce gross receipts for TN business tax but reduce excise-taxable income.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training, education & professional development

Continuing Education & Workshops

You can deduct training that improves your current photography or business skills. This includes workshops, online courses, and conferences. Save receipts and course descriptions to support the connection to your existing business.

Dues paid to photography associations and subscriptions to trade magazines or educational platforms are deductible. Even premium portfolios or tutorial sites qualify if used for business growth. Keep receipts and track any auto-renewals.

$

Licenses, Certifications & Development

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing & permits

Business Insurance Premiums

Insurance premiums for liability, property, gear, and business interruption coverage are deductible. Includes photographer-specific policies and equipment coverage.

Business Licenses & Permits

Annual fees for business licenses, permits for shooting in parks or public areas, and state registration filings are fully deductible. Includes DBA registration, LLC filing fees, and vendor permits. Fines or penalties, however, are not deductible.

Legal & Professional Services

Fees for attorneys drafting contracts, CPAs handling taxes, and consultants advising your business are deductible. Also includes subscriptions for bookkeeping software or online filing tools. Keep all invoices, receipts, and engagement letters to support these deductions.

$

Miscellaneous Financial Fees

$

Certifications & Licenses

CPP certification, FAA drone exam fees, or CPR training (for adventure shooters) are deductible. Tennessee allows these expenses fully. Startup licensing costs are amortized if over $5K, otherwise deducted in the first year.

$

Dues to PPA, WPPI, and other professional groups are deductible unless used for lobbying. Tennessee honors full deduction. Retain invoices and note any nondeductible lobbying amounts if indicated by the organization.

$

Other Taxes & Filing Fees

Business-related taxes (excluding federal income/self-employment tax) and administrative fees are deductible. Includes personal property tax on business assets and annual LLC filing fees. Deduct taxes only if they are directly connected to business operations and filings.

$

Print & Product Packaging

Expenses for shipping prints, custom packaging, and presentation materials are deductible. Includes photo boxes, padded mailers, and branded delivery sleeves. These are considered direct business expenses when associated with delivering physical goods or work.

Creative Labor for Deliverables

Outsourcing image retouching or design for deliverables like albums or print layouts is deductible. These are considered production costs tied to your customer-facing products and reduce your taxable business income like other contract services.
