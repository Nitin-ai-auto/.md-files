Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Business Equipment Purchases & Depreciation

Cameras, lenses, lighting gear, and computers used 100% for photography are deductible using Section 179 or depreciation. New Mexico conforms to federal Section 179 limits but disallows federal bonus depreciation. Maintain separate depreciation schedules for NM returns.
