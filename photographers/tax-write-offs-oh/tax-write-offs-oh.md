Equipment & Gear Essentials
---------------------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases (Section 179 or Depreciation)

Cameras, lenses, lighting kits, and other core gear can be expensed via Section 179 or depreciated. Ohio allows only $25,000 in Section 179 deductions and disallows federal bonus depreciation beyond that. Excess is deducted over future years.

$

Computers, Editing Tech & Off-the-Shelf Software

Laptops, monitors, and editing software like Lightroom and Photoshop are deductible. Most software qualifies for immediate expensing under Section 179. Ohio follows federal rules but limits depreciation above the $25,000 Section 179 cap.

$

Repair & Maintenance of Gear

Camera cleanings, lens repairs, and equipment maintenance are deductible as operating expenses. No depreciation applies. Ohio recognizes these as ordinary business deductions—include the full amount paid (including any sales tax).

$

Sales Tax on Equipment Purchases

Sales tax is generally included in the total cost of the asset and depreciated accordingly. Ohio sales tax on gear is not separately deductible but is included in the capitalized basis of the item.

$

Recordkeeping & State Adjustments

Maintain receipts, usage logs, and Form 4562 for depreciation. If you expense more than $25k under Section 179 federally, you must adjust your Ohio return by adding back the excess and depreciating it over five years.

$

Studio, Utilities & Insurance
-----------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio or Office Rent (Commercial Space or Coworking)

Rent for a dedicated studio or office is fully deductible. This includes coworking fees, studio leases, and short-term venue rentals. Ohio conforms to federal rules—rent flows through AGI and reduces your Ohio taxable income with no additional state cap.

$

Utilities & Internet for Studio Space

Electricity, water, internet, and phone expenses tied to your studio or rented workspace are deductible. If utilities are included in rent, that total is expensed. Ohio doesn’t require special treatment—utilities are ordinary deductions at both federal and state levels.

$

Home Office Deduction (Exclusive Use)

If you work from home, you may deduct a portion of home expenses via the simplified or regular method. Ohio accepts the federal home office deduction without adjustment. Depreciation recapture from home office will be taxed if you later sell your home.

$

Insurance Premiums (Studio, Liability & Gear)

General liability, professional liability, and property insurance premiums are fully deductible. Ohio accepts the full expense without state-level modification. Workers’ comp premiums paid to the Ohio state fund are deductible as well.

$

Dual-Use Considerations & Documentation

Only the business-use portion of utilities, space, or insurance is deductible. Ohio uses the federal percentage allocation and requires no separate form. Maintain a floor plan or photos of the space and keep records of utility bills or policy premiums.

$

Travel & Transportation in Ohio
-------------------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Business Mileage or Actual Auto Expenses

Travel to client sites, shoots, and business errands can be deducted using the standard mileage rate ($0.67/mile for 2024) or actual expenses. Ohio mirrors federal rules. Commuting isn’t deductible. Maintain logs, receipts, and choose one method per vehicle.

$

Depreciation on Business Vehicles

If using actual expenses, you may depreciate the business-use portion of your vehicle. Ohio follows federal depreciation but limits Section 179 to $25,000 and disallows excess bonus depreciation—add it back and deduct over five years.

$

Parking, Tolls & Business Driving Costs

Business-related parking fees and tolls are deductible regardless of mileage method. These are ordinary expenses in Ohio and flow directly through AGI. Save receipts and document each trip’s business purpose to substantiate claims.

$

Travel Lodging, Airfare & Transportation

Hotel, airfare, train, and rental car expenses for out-of-town business travel are deductible if incurred while working. Ohio conforms to federal treatment—expenses reduce income via AGI with no separate limitation or add-back required.

$

Meals While Traveling (50% Deduction Rule)

Business meals during overnight trips are 50% deductible. This includes meals with clients if business is discussed. Ohio honors the federal 50% rule—no adjustment is made for the disallowed portion. Maintain records of cost, date, and business reason.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants Deductions
--------------------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Independent Contractors (1099 Labor)

Payments to second shooters, freelance editors, assistants, or makeup artists are fully deductible. Collect W-9s and issue 1099-NEC if over $600. Ohio adopts federal treatment—these reduce net profit and help lower state income via the Business Income Deduction.

$

Employee Wages & Payroll Costs

If you hire employees, wages, payroll taxes, and benefits are deductible. Ohio doesn’t adjust these at the state level. Employer-paid state unemployment or workers’ comp insurance are also deductible. Keep payroll records, tax filings, and contracts on file.

$

Contract Labor vs. Employee Classification

Misclassifying workers can trigger IRS or Ohio audits. Ensure independent contractors meet federal and Ohio guidelines—control, independence, and project scope all matter. Misclassification can result in back taxes and penalties. Consult legal or tax help if unsure.

$

Subcontractor Services Documentation

Keep invoices, contracts, payment proof, and job descriptions for all contractors. Label these costs as “Contract Labor” on Schedule C. Ohio follows federal AGI, so full documentation helps ensure deductibility on both state and federal returns.

$

Business Income Deduction Advantage

Payments to contractors reduce net business income—lowering your Ohio tax through the $250,000 Business Income Deduction. These expenses not only reduce Schedule C income but also your taxable income for Ohio’s flat tax rate calculation.

$

Training & Professional Development in Ohio
-------------------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

Workshops, Classes & Certification Costs

Photography workshops, courses, and credentialing programs are deductible if they improve your current skills. Ohio follows IRS rules—education must relate to your existing trade, not a new one. Keep invoices, course descriptions, and attendance proof.

$

Conferences & Travel for Learning

Travel for business-related conferences and seminars—like airfare, hotel, and meals—is deductible. Ohio conforms to federal limits (e.g., 50% meal rule). You’ll deduct full travel costs and 50% of meal expenses on Schedule C and Ohio accepts those figures.

$

Online Subscriptions & Educational Platforms

Subscriptions to online learning services (e.g., Skillshare, MasterClass for photographers) are deductible. If used for business education, Ohio honors the deduction. Track usage and save payment confirmations to support the business purpose if audited.

$

Professional Licensing & Recertification

Fees paid for maintaining professional credentials (e.g., Certified Professional Photographer) are deductible as educational costs. Ohio accepts these expenses as they appear on your federal return—ensure the certification aligns with your current business activity.

$

Memberships & Industry Associations

Dues for photography associations (like PPA or local guilds) are fully deductible. These are considered ordinary business expenses. Ohio follows IRS treatment—ensure the primary purpose is business-related and retain receipts or digital confirmations of payment.

$

Marketing & Advertising Costs
-----------------------------

Deductions for marketing & advertising

Advertising & Promotional Materials

Costs for ads, printed materials, and promotional campaigns (online or print) are fully deductible. Ohio follows federal rules—expenses reduce taxable business income. Keep records of ad spend, creative samples, and vendor receipts for verification.

$

Client Gifts & Branded Giveaways

Client thank-you items like branded merchandise are deductible as advertising. Ohio accepts IRS limits—$25 per client annually for non-branded gifts; branded items are classified as promotion and fully deductible. Keep a list of recipients and itemized receipts.

$

Website, Hosting & Online Tools

Expenses for domain names, hosting, website builders (e.g., Wix, Squarespace), and plugins are deductible. Ohio conforms with federal treatment—costs can be expensed as incurred. Save all receipts and renewal confirmations as proof of business use.

$

Business Phone, Internet & Communication Tools

A dedicated business phone line, Zoom subscription, or portion of internet used for client interaction or marketing is deductible. Ohio accepts the federal approach—allocate the business-use portion and document usage if services are shared with personal use.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for insurance & licenses

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, equipment, and professional liability insurance are fully deductible. Ohio mirrors federal treatment—expenses reduce taxable income. Keep policy docs, payment confirmations, and coverage descriptions for each insured period.

$

Property & Studio Insurance

Insurance for rented studio space or home office areas is deductible. Ohio includes these costs in business deductions without adjustment. Be sure to distinguish business-use-only spaces and maintain clear lease or mortgage insurance coverage records.

$

Workers Comp & Commercial Auto Policies

If you pay workers compensation (Ohio-run fund) or commercial vehicle insurance, premiums are fully deductible. Ohio allows full deduction on your return—document percentage of business use for vehicle policies and keep BWC filings if applicable.

$

Licenses, Permits & Regulatory Fees

State vendor licenses, LLC registration, park/photo shoot permits, and local business permits are deductible. Ohio accepts all as ordinary business expenses. Include any sales tax license, city fee, or certification renewal used for your photography work.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies (Business Use)
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Props, Backdrops & Small Supplies

Low-cost items like props, paper rolls, seasonal decor, and batteries can be deducted as supplies if under $2,500 per item. Ohio follows federal rules and allows immediate deduction—just ensure they’re used for business and not personal purposes.

$

Albums, Prints & Client Deliverables

Photo albums, USBs, frames, and print products included in client packages are deductible. Ohio treats these either as supplies or cost of goods sold. If for resale, use your vendor’s license to buy tax-free and collect sales tax from clients.

$

Office & Studio Supplies

Pens, paper, USB drives, printer ink, folders, and snacks for in-studio clients are deductible. Ohio conforms to federal treatment. Items like snacks are 100% deductible when provided on business premises—track these separately from gifts or meals.

$

Use Tax on Untaxed Purchases

If you purchase supplies online without sales tax, Ohio requires use tax. Paying it does not change deductibility—just include it in total item cost. Watch for this especially on bulk packaging, backdrops, or studio props from out-of-state vendors.

$

Safe Harbor & Inventory Records

Use the IRS $2,500 safe harbor to deduct small tools and supplies without depreciation. Ohio honors this method. Maintain a simple inventory list or spreadsheet for props and supplies in case of audit—especially if reused across shoots.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Credits
--------------------------------------------

Deductions for financial expenses

Bank Fees & Payment Processors

Monthly bank service fees, wire charges, and payment processor cuts (e.g. Stripe, PayPal) are deductible. Ohio mirrors federal rules—just track these through statements and deduct the gross amount charged, including any embedded sales tax.

$

Interest on Business Loans & Credit

Interest on loans or credit cards used strictly for business is deductible. Only the interest—not principal—is expensed. Ohio allows full deduction unless federal limits apply (rare for small businesses). Keep clear usage and loan records.

$

Financing Charges & Origination Costs

Origination fees or finance charges for business loans (including equipment loans or studio mortgages) are deductible or amortized. Ohio conforms fully. Include any charges on your amortization schedule if they exceed one year in benefit.

$

Professional Services (CPA, Lawyer, Tax Help)

Legal, bookkeeping, and accounting fees for your business (e.g. drafting contracts, Schedule C prep) are deductible. Ohio has no adjustment—professional service fees flow through as ordinary deductions. Save invoices for all paid professionals.
