Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

Cameras, lenses, and computers may be expensed under Section 179 or depreciated over time. NH follows federal depreciation rules but caps Section 179 at $500,000. NH disallows federal bonus depreciation—add it back for BPT.

$

Equipment Repairs & Maintenance

Routine repairs, cleanings, sensor calibrations, and part replacements are deductible business expenses. Keep detailed receipts for all services. NH treats these as ordinary deductions under BPT, no state adjustment needed.

$

Equipment Rentals

Short-term gear rentals (lighting kits, lenses, etc.) are fully deductible. NH has no sales tax, so rental costs are simpler—deduct what you pay without tracking tax add-ons. Lease-to-own deals may require capitalization and depreciation.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance WV
--------------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses in WV

Studio Rent & Utilities

Rent paid for a studio or coworking space is 100% deductible. Utilities like electricity, heat, water, and internet used exclusively for business also qualify. NH recognizes these deductions under BPT; no sales tax applies.

$

Home Office Deduction

If you work from home, deduct a portion of rent, utilities, and insurance. Use the simplified method ($5/sq ft) or actual expenses via IRS Form 8829. NH accepts the federal method—expenses reduce BPT profit.

$

Business Insurance Premiums

Liability, property, and equipment insurance premiums are fully deductible. This includes riders for business use of your home. NH allows these deductions without limitation and imposes no special insurance premium tax or disallowance.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Use & Mileage

Business driving is deductible using the IRS mileage rate (e.g., $0.67/mile in 2024) or actual costs (fuel, insurance, repairs). Keep a mileage log. NH follows federal rules—no adjustment for mileage or vehicle depreciation.

$

Out-of-Town Travel

Travel for shoots, conferences, or client meetings—airfare, train, lodging, and transport—is fully deductible. NH recognizes these as valid deductions under BPT. Hotel taxes (like NH’s 8.5% meals & rooms tax) are part of the deductible total.

$

Business Meals While Traveling

Meals during business travel are 50% deductible. This includes meals at NH restaurants, with the 8.5% meals tax included in the deduction. NH mirrors the federal rule—there’s no additional credit or deduction for that meals tax.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors and assistants

Independent Contractor Payments

Fees paid to second shooters, editors, or assistants are fully deductible as contract labor. If you pay $600+ to any contractor, issue a 1099-NEC. NH follows federal rules—these costs reduce your taxable business income.

$

1099 Compliance & Records

Collect a W-9 from each contractor. Track payments and keep receipts or contracts. NH doesn’t require state 1099 filings. Contractor pay is not subject to the NH BET—only wages count toward that base.

$

Employee Wages

If you have employees, wages and payroll taxes are deductible. However, employee compensation counts toward NH’s BET base (0.55%). Most freelancers avoid BET if gross receipts stay under NH’s filing threshold.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training, education & professional development

Workshop & Course Fees

Workshops, classes, and photography seminars that improve your current skills are deductible. NH follows federal rules. Keep receipts and course outlines to show business relevance—education must relate to your current business.

$

Travel for Education in NH

Lodging and travel to attend business-related workshops are deductible as travel expenses. NH allows these deductions through federal AGI. Be sure the primary trip purpose is education. Save booking confirmations and itineraries.

$

Professional Dues & Resources

Memberships in groups like PPA, trade magazines, online tutorial sites, and professional certifications are deductible. NH allows these as ordinary business costs. No special credits apply—just ensure they support your business.

$

Marketing, Advertising & Website Cost
-------------------------------------

Deductions for marketing, advertising & website cost

Advertising & Promotion

Online ads, printed materials, bridal show booths, and social media promotions are 100% deductible. NH follows federal rules with no additional caps or taxes. Keep receipts for ad placements and design services.

$

Website & Online Tools

Domain registration, hosting, templates, SEO help, and gallery platform fees are fully deductible. NH has no sales tax on digital services, so these costs are lower. Track subscription receipts or designer invoices.

$

Branding & Collateral

Logo design, business cards, brochures, and sample albums for display are marketing expenses. NH treats these as deductible costs and doesn’t tax advertising services. Ensure expenses are business-related and documented.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing & permits

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, equipment, and studio insurance are fully deductible. If home-based, prorate renter’s or homeowner’s insurance. NH follows federal rules—no adjustments or disallowance for insurance costs.

$

Business Licenses & Permits

Fees for forming an LLC, filing a DBA, or renewing annual reports with NH are deductible. Permits for location shoots (e.g., public park) count too. NH doesn’t require a state photography license.

$

Legal & Compliance Costs

Attorney or accountant fees tied to business setup, contracts, or compliance are deductible. NH allows full deduction and imposes no separate license tax. Categorize these properly on your Schedule C or business return.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for props, backdrops & consumable supplies

Photography Supplies & Props

Items like memory cards, lighting bulbs, backdrops, and props are 100% deductible if used for business. NH mirrors federal treatment and allows full deduction without adjustments or state inventory tax.

$

Production & Packaging Materials

Photo paper, client USBs, albums, frames, and shipping materials are deductible. If you maintain inventory, deduct when sold. NH follows federal COGS rules and doesn’t tax unsold business inventory.

$

Expense Classification

Use the de minimis rule (up to $2,500 per item) to expense props instead of depreciating. NH has no sales or use tax—so purchases aren’t taxed in-state and there’s no added compliance for imports.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Deductions for bank fees, loan interest & financial expenses

Bank & Merchant Fees

Monthly service charges, wire fees, and payment processing cuts (from PayPal, Stripe, etc.) are deductible. NH conforms to federal rules—no special treatment. Maintain annual statements and processor summaries.

$

Loan & Credit Interest

Interest on business loans, equipment financing, or business-use credit cards is deductible. NH fully honors federal interest deductions. Use market rates for related-party loans and allocate interest by business-use percent.

$

Financial Tools & Charges

Currency conversion fees, accounting software, bookkeeping services, or payroll tool subscriptions are deductible. NH imposes no additional tax on financial tools. These costs reduce your business profit for BPT and BET.

$

Other Deductions (Niche & State-Specific)
-----------------------------------------

Deductions for niche and state-specific expenses

Business Meals

Meals with clients or during travel are 50% deductible. NH follows the federal 50% rule. Include 8.5% NH meals tax in the total expense. Save itemized receipts and note attendees and business purpose.

$

Professional Services

Legal, accounting, or consulting fees for your business are fully deductible. NH has no special restrictions. If the service relates to NH business compliance (e.g. BPT help), it is deductible under ordinary expenses.

$

Startup & Mixed-Use Costs

Startup costs up to $5,000 are deductible in year one. NH follows federal rules. For mixed-use assets like phones or vehicles, deduct only the business-use percentage. Maintain records supporting allocation.
