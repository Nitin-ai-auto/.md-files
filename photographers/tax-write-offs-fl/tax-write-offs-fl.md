Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

You can deduct the full cost of gear like cameras and lighting using Section 179 or depreciation. Florida has no personal income tax, so there's no state-level adjustment. Sales tax paid on purchases becomes part of your deductible federal cost. Use IRS Form 4562.

$

Small Equipment & Supplies

Items under $2,500 like tripods, batteries, and SD cards can be expensed immediately under the federal de minimis rule. Florida mirrors federal treatment with no extra reporting. Maintain receipts and usage logs for audit support.

$

Sales Tax & Use Tax on Equipment

Florida charges 6% state sales tax (plus local surtax) on gear bought in-state. If you purchase online or out-of-state without sales tax, you must pay Florida use tax. The only exemption is for qualified film/media companies with a state certificate.

$

Business Personal Property Tax

Florida counties assess tangible personal property (TPP) tax on business equipment. The first $25,000 of value per county is exempt, but you must file Form DR-405 annually by April 1 to claim it. Deduct any property tax paid on your federal return.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance FL
--------------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses in FL

Studio Rent & Commercial Space

Rent for a photography studio or coworking space is fully deductible. In Florida, commercial leases are subject to 2% state sales tax plus any local surtax—this sales tax is part of your deductible rent expense. Retain lease agreements and gross rent receipts.

$

Home Office Deduction

If you work from home, you may deduct $5/sq ft up to 300 sq ft (simplified method) or actual business-use percentages of mortgage, rent, utilities, and insurance. Florida has no personal income tax, so these deductions affect only your federal return.

$

Utilities & Internet

Deduct utility bills such as electricity, internet, and water for your studio or home office. If using a portion of your home, allocate costs based on square footage or time used. Cell phone costs are also deductible for the business-use percentage.

$

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for business liability, gear insurance, and renters insurance are fully deductible. Florida doesn’t impose extra taxes on these policies. If you have employees, workers’ comp is required once you reach 4+ staff and is also deductible.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Business Vehicle Use & Mileage

Photographers can deduct vehicle use via standard mileage (e.g., 65.5¢/mile in 2023) or actual expenses (gas, insurance, maintenance). Florida has no personal income tax, so these deductions affect only federal returns. Maintain a mileage log and receipts.

$

Travel for Out-of-Town Shoots

Trips for client work or conferences outside your local area are deductible, including airfare, hotel, rental car, and 50% of meal costs. Florida does not add state tax complications, but sales tax on hotel stays and rental cars is part of your deductible cost.

$

Meals During Business Travel

Business meals are 50% deductible under federal rules. Florida corporate tax also limits meal deductions to 50%, even during periods when the IRS allowed 100%. Keep itemized receipts with the purpose and attendees noted.

$

Tolls, Parking & Local Transit

Tolls, parking fees, taxis, rideshare, and public transit fares for business use are fully deductible. Commuting from home to a studio is not deductible. Florida follows federal treatment and does not alter these deductions.

$

Rental Car Surcharge

If renting a car in Florida for business, you’ll pay a $2/day rental surcharge plus local taxes. These fees are part of your deductible travel costs. Save all rental receipts for documentation.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors and assistants

Independent Contractors (1099 Freelancers)

Fees paid to second shooters, editors, or makeup artists are fully deductible. Florida doesn’t require state W-2s or income tax withholding but does require a 1099-NEC for payments over $600. Collect W-9s and track all contractor payments.

$

Employees & Payroll Costs

If you hire employees (e.g., studio manager), wages, payroll taxes, and benefits are deductible. Florida has no state income tax withholding, but you must register and file quarterly reemployment tax (unemployment) returns. Use Form RT-6 for state reporting.

$

Payroll Tax & Workers’ Comp

Florida employers owe reemployment tax (2.7% on the first $7,000 in wages for new businesses). Workers' comp is also required if you have ≥4 non-construction employees. All employer-paid payroll taxes and premiums are deductible at the federal and state level.

$

Misclassification Risk

Florida follows IRS rules to distinguish contractors from employees. Misclassifying a worker can result in steep fines—intentional misclassification is a felony. Avoid treating someone as a contractor if you direct their work and schedule.

$

Hiring Family Members

Florida allows you to deduct wages paid to a spouse or child in your business, following federal rules. Children under 21 are exempt from Florida’s reemployment tax. Keep payroll records as with any employee to avoid audit issues.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training, education & professional development

Photography Courses & Workshops

You can deduct costs for business-related classes—lighting workshops, editing tutorials, and seminar fees. Florida has no income tax, so these education write-offs benefit your federal return only. Save receipts and document the skill relevance.

$

Certifications & Continuing Education

If you maintain certifications (like CPP from PPA), renewal fees and required classes are deductible. Florida offers no education tax credits for small businesses, but expenses reduce your federal and corporate taxable income if incorporated.

$

Subscriptions & Learning Materials

Books, trade magazines, and subscriptions to platforms like KelbyOne or CreativeLive are 100% deductible. These aren’t taxed in Florida unless bundled with physical products. Retain payment records or credit card statements for proof.

$

Mentorship & Coaching

Hiring a business coach or mentor to improve your craft or operations counts as a write-off. Florida law treats these services as tax-exempt (no sales tax). Document agreements and keep proof of business purpose.

$

College Tuition & Academic Courses

College classes may qualify if they maintain your current profession. Florida doesn’t distinguish or provide credits here—just ensure you’re not training for a new career. Deduct short-term, business-related courses on your federal return only.

$

Marketing, Advertising & Website Cost
-------------------------------------

Deductions for marketing, advertising & website cost

Advertising & Promotion Expenses

All promotional costs—Google/Facebook ads, print flyers, event sponsorships—are fully deductible. Florida does not tax advertising services, so fees to designers or marketers are not subject to sales tax. Keep ad receipts and service contracts.

$

Website & Online Portfolio

Costs for domain registration, web hosting, template purchases, and platforms like Squarespace or SmugMug are deductible. Florida does not tax electronically delivered services like hosting or templates unless bundled with tangible items.

$

Printed Materials & Business Cards

Printing business cards, brochures, or mailers is deductible. You’ll pay Florida’s 6% state sales tax plus county surtax on these items. Sales tax paid becomes part of your deductible cost. Use your receipts to document.

$

Social Media Marketing & Content Creation

Paying someone to manage social media, design a logo, or create content is deductible. Service fees to Florida-based marketing freelancers are exempt from sales tax. Any printed materials produced as part of a campaign are taxable to you.

$

Resale of Advertising Products

If you sell ad-related products (e.g., branded prints, promo DVDs), you must collect sales tax. Use your Florida resale certificate to avoid tax when buying those items. Deduct your total cost as a business expense.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing & permits

Business Insurance Premiums

Policies for liability, equipment coverage, errors & omissions, or commercial auto are fully deductible. Florida doesn’t tax insurance premiums separately. Be sure to retain invoices, policy terms, and proof of payment for your records.

$

Legal & Professional Services

Attorney and accountant fees, contract drafting, and business consulting are deductible. Florida follows federal treatment—no added state benefit, but these reduce taxable income for C-corps. Ensure professional fees are clearly business-related.

$

Local Business Licenses

Most Florida cities/counties require a Local Business Tax Receipt. The $25–$100+ annual fee is deductible. There's no state-level business license, but fictitious name registration (about $50 every 5 years) is also deductible if you don’t operate under your legal name.

$

Permits & Specialty Fees

Fees for photography permits on city or state land (e.g., $75 for park access) are deductible. Florida state parks may require permits for commercial shoots after hours. FAA drone license exam fees are deductible too if drone use is business-related.

$

State Registration & Franchise Fees

LLCs and corporations pay annual state fees: $138.75 for LLCs, $150 for corps. These are deductible admin expenses. Florida does not charge franchise tax for most businesses, but C-corps may owe 5.5% income tax on profits over $50,000.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for props, backdrops & consumable supplies

Props & Set Pieces

Items like furniture, or scene elements used in shoots are 100% deductible. Florida charges sales tax (6% + county surtax) on these purchases. Include sales tax in your cost basis. Keep receipts and track prop reuse versus resale.

$

Backdrops & Studio Equipment

Seamless paper, light stands, clamps, storage drives, and similar gear are deductible when purchased for studio use. These are typically low-cost and fully expensed. Florida taxes these purchases unless used in tax-exempt production.

$

Consumables

Batteries, lens wipes, cleaning sprays, ink, photo paper, and film are deductible as used. Florida sales tax applies unless the items qualify as resale inputs (e.g., paper/ink embedded in sold prints). Keep detailed purchase logs.

$

Client Products for Resale

Albums, framed prints, and USB drives sold to clients count as cost of goods sold (COGS). You may use Florida’s Resale Certificate to buy them tax-free. You must then collect sales tax from clients and keep resale records to stay compliant.

$

Office Supplies

Business-use items like pens, paper, and folders are deductible. Florida treats these as standard purchases with sales tax due at time of purchase. Sales tax is part of the deductible cost; retain purchase receipts.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Deductions for bank fees, loan interest & financial expenses

Bank Fees

Monthly fees from business bank accounts, check ordering, and wire charges are fully deductible. Florida has no income tax, so these deductions only affect your federal return. Save bank statements showing all fee details.

$

Payment Processing Fees

Processor fees from Stripe, Square, PayPal, etc., are deductible. Florida does not tax these fees or require special reporting. Use your 1099-K or annual processor reports to track total deductions accurately.

$

Loan Interest

Interest on business loans or credit cards used for business purchases is deductible. Florida follows federal treatment for corporate returns but has no personal income tax—so these deductions only impact federal taxes for sole props.

$

Business Credit Card Annual Fees

Annual fees on business credit cards, finance charges, and even late fees (if business-related) are deductible. Be sure to separate business vs. personal accounts to maintain clean documentation for audits.

$

Bad Debts (Accrual Only)

You can deduct unpaid client invoices only if you report income on the accrual basis. Most photographers use cash basis, so this typically doesn’t apply. Florida follows federal income standards—no special rules for this deduction.
