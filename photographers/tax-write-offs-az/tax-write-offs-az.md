Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

You can deduct the full cost of cameras, lenses, computers, and gear using Section 179 or bonus depreciation. Arizona conforms to federal rules post-2016, so you can write off most purchases immediately. Track business use and file IRS Form 4562.

$

Small Equipment & De Minimis Expensing

Items under $2,500—like tripods, memory cards, cables, or accessories—can be expensed in the year of purchase under the IRS safe harbor. Arizona follows federal expensing rules. Maintain receipts and log usage to confirm business purpose.

$

Sales Tax on Equipment

Arizona does not exempt photographers from sales tax on equipment. You must pay TPT (sales tax) at purchase, and this becomes part of your deductible cost. Resale certificates only apply to items bought for resale, not gear for service use.

$

Legacy Depreciation Add-Back (Old Assets Only)

If you used bonus depreciation or excess §179 on older assets (pre-2016), Arizona required depreciation adjustments. Continue those state add-backs/subtractions until the asset is fully depreciated. New purchases no longer require separate tracking.

$

No Investment Tax Credit (ITC) Offered

Arizona does not offer a general small business investment tax credit for equipment purchases. All deductions happen through depreciation or expensing under §179 or bonus rules. No state form is required unless part of a niche credit program.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance
-----------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio or Office Rent (Commercial Space)

Rent paid for studio, office, or co-working space is fully deductible. Arizona imposes a commercial lease TPT (sales tax), which your landlord typically collects. The full rent, including tax, is deductible on your federal and Arizona returns.

$

Utilities & Studio Insurance (Business Use Only)

Electricity, water, internet, gas, and renter’s insurance tied to your business space are deductible. Keep bills and policy records. Arizona follows federal treatment—these ordinary and necessary costs lower your Arizona taxable income automatically.

$

Home Office Deduction

You can deduct a portion of home expenses if a room is used exclusively and regularly for business. Arizona follows the federal rules (Form 8829 or simplified method). Deductions flow through to your state return with no separate form.

$

Simplified or Actual Method

Use the $5 per sq ft simplified method (max $1,500) or deduct your share of home rent, utilities, insurance, and repairs based on square footage. Arizona accepts either method with no state-specific limitation or calculation requirement.

$

No State Limits or Forms Required

Arizona does not impose additional restrictions or require separate documentation for rent, utilities, or home office deductions. If eligible and claimed on your federal Schedule C, these deductions are fully recognized by the state.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Expenses

If you drive for shoots or meetings, deduct auto expenses using either the standard mileage rate (67¢ per mile in 2024) or actual expenses (gas, insurance, repairs, etc.). Arizona conforms to federal rules with no separate mileage rate or forms.

$

Vehicle Depreciation & Section 179

For business-owned vehicles, you can depreciate or expense using Section 179 if eligible. Arizona now fully conforms—no state add-back for post-2017 bonus depreciation. Keep mileage logs and expense documentation for audits.

$

Airfare, Hotels, & Local Transit

Airfare, hotels, baggage fees, rideshares, and taxis for client work or conferences are deductible. Arizona mirrors federal rules, allowing full deduction of travel costs that are ordinary and necessary for your business.

$

Meals While Traveling

Meals while on overnight business travel are 50% deductible. Arizona uses the same 50% limit as federal. Keep receipts or per diem logs and document the business purpose. Day trip meals are not deductible.

$

No Arizona-Specific Travel Rules

Arizona does not impose unique travel deduction rules or require separate forms. As long as expenses are deducted federally under ordinary and necessary standards, they reduce Arizona taxable income the same way.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors and assistants

Independent Contractors (1099-NEC Requirement)

Payments to freelance second shooters, editors, or assistants are deductible. Issue Form 1099-NEC if you pay $600+ to an unincorporated contractor. Arizona recognizes this deduction fully with no separate state form required unless state tax is withheld.

$

Worker Classification

Make sure contractors are correctly classified—use their own tools, control their own time, and are hired per job. Misclassification could trigger penalties from Arizona Department of Economic Security. Independent contractors do not require state withholding.

$

Proof of Payment & Documentation

Keep signed contracts, invoices, and payment records (bank or PayPal statements). Arizona follows federal rules: proper documentation ensures the deduction is valid and helps if challenged during a state review.

$

Employee Wages & Payroll Taxes

If you hire employees, their wages and employer payroll taxes are deductible. Arizona allows the same federal deductions. Register for Arizona withholding and unemployment insurance if you hire staff.

$

Arizona Hiring Tax Credits

Some credits exist for hiring certain groups (e.g., TANF recipients), but if you claim one, you must add back those expenses on the Arizona return. Most photographers won’t use these, but keep in mind if applicable.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training, education & professional development

Workshops & Business Skill Training

Courses, seminars, or photography workshops that improve your existing skills are deductible. Arizona mirrors federal rules, allowing expenses that are “ordinary and necessary” for your current business—not for entering a new trade.

$

Professional Books & Subscriptions

Trade publications, industry books, and online platforms (e.g. KelbyOne, CreativeLive) qualify as deductions. Arizona imposes no extra rules; these reduce taxable income if listed on your federal Schedule C.

$

Conference & Expo Fees

Tickets to industry conferences or photography expos are deductible. If you travel for these events, your lodging, airfare, and 50% of meals can also be deducted under travel rules. Arizona accepts these deductions in full.

$

State Credits

Arizona does not offer specific credits for self-employed continuing education. Credits exist for employer-provided job training, but these don’t apply unless you have employees and participate in state-certified training programs.

$

Professional Membership Dues

Fees for joining photography associations or local business chambers are fully deductible. Arizona does not limit these, except for non-deductible lobbying portions, which follow federal disallowance rules.

$

Marketing, Advertising & Website Cost
-------------------------------------

Deductions for marketing, advertising & website cost

Advertising & Client Promotion

Costs for ads (Google, Facebook, magazines), business cards, brochures, or styled shoot promos are 100% deductible. Arizona treats these as ordinary business expenses. Any sales tax on printed materials is part of the deductible cost.

$

Website & Hosting Fees

Domain fees, hosting services, and subscriptions for platforms like Pixieset or SmugMug are deductible. Arizona does not require amortization for routine costs. If the expense is large (e.g. custom website), you may amortize over 3 years.

$

SEO, Online Listings & Portfolio Tools

Marketing tools like SEO services, client CRMs, or vendor listing sites (e.g. The Knot) are deductible marketing expenses. Arizona offers no state-specific restrictions—if it’s deducted federally, it reduces Arizona taxable income too.

$

Business Gifts & Appreciation Events

Gifts are limited to $25 per person annually (federal rule also followed by Arizona). Client thank-you events are deductible if used for promotion (meals may be 50–100% deductible depending on nature). Arizona conforms to these limits.

$

State Sales Tax Considerations

If marketing materials are printed in Arizona, sales tax applies and is included in the deductible expense. If purchased out-of-state without sales tax, you may owe Arizona use tax—file via Form 5000 or your TPT return.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing & permits

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for liability, equipment, studio, and professional insurance are deductible. Arizona fully allows these deductions. Workers’ comp and unemployment insurance (if you have employees) are also deductible business expenses.

$

Health Insurance (Self-Employed)

Self-employed health insurance is not deducted on Schedule C, but is an adjustment to income on Form 1040. Arizona conforms to federal AGI, so the deduction flows through automatically—no need to list it separately on state returns.

$

Business Licenses & TPT Fees

Arizona TPT (Transaction Privilege Tax) licenses and city business licenses are deductible. The state fee is $12 annually. Local permit fees for vendor booths or shoot locations (e.g. park permits) are deductible if directly tied to your business.

$

Professional Registration Fees

Fees paid to register an LLC, trade name, or renew a business entity with the Arizona Corporation Commission (e.g. $50 for LLC formation) are deductible. These reduce taxable income on both federal and Arizona returns.

$

State Income Tax Exclusion

State and federal income taxes are not deductible on Schedule C or on your Arizona return. This includes Arizona estimated taxes, late payment penalties, or interest—only business-related license or regulatory fees qualify for deduction.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for props, backdrops & consumable supplies

Props & Set Materials

Props, backdrops items under $2,500 can be expensed in full under the IRS de minimis rule. Arizona follows this federal threshold. Track receipts and label purchases clearly if used for client-facing setups or styled sessions.

$

Rental Fees for Props or Gear

Short-term rentals of props, lighting, or staging gear are fully deductible. Keep rental agreements or receipts for documentation. Arizona treats these costs as ordinary business expenses and does not impose additional restrictions.

$

Consumable Supplies (Photo & Office Use)

Printer ink, paper, client packaging, USBs, lens wipes, batteries, and cleaning materials are deductible in the year purchased. Office supplies like pens and notebooks also qualify. Arizona aligns with federal treatment—no added rules.

$

Cost of Goods Sold (Deliverables)

If you resell prints, frames, or albums to clients, the purchase cost is part of your cost of goods sold (COGS). Use Arizona’s resale exemption for wholesale purchases and collect TPT on client sales. Deduct the wholesale cost as COGS.

$

Sales Tax on Supplies

When you buy props or consumables for use—not resale—you must pay Arizona sales tax. This tax is part of your deductible expense. Use a resale certificate only for items directly resold to clients; otherwise, pay tax and deduct the total cost.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Deductions for bank fees, loan interest & financial expenses

Bank Account & Payment Processing Fees

Monthly fees on business checking accounts, wire transfers, PayPal/Stripe fees, and card processing fees are deductible. Arizona treats these as ordinary business expenses. Keep statements from your bank or payment processors for records.

$

Business Loan & Credit Card Interest

Interest on loans or credit cards used for business (e.g., buying gear or covering expenses) is deductible. Arizona conforms to federal rules and allows full deduction unless the loan generates tax-free income (rare for photographers).

$

Auto Loan Interest (Business Use %)

If you finance a vehicle for business use, deduct the business-use portion of loan interest. Track total vs. business miles to determine the deductible percentage. Arizona mirrors federal treatment—no additional state requirements.

$

Financial Software & App Fees

Fees for bookkeeping or invoicing tools like QuickBooks or FreshBooks are deductible if used for business. Arizona treats these as ordinary expenses; categorize them under software, office, or miscellaneous expenses.

$

Late Fees & Currency Exchange Costs

Late payment fees, international transaction charges, and currency conversion fees for client payments are deductible. Avoid fines or government penalties—they’re not deductible federally or in Arizona. Keep receipts and logs for these costs.

$

Other State-Specific Deductions or Benefits
-------------------------------------------

Other state-specific deductions or benefits

Arizona Business Credits (Rare Cases)

Arizona offers credits for solar installs, R&D, or hiring incentives. These rarely apply to photographers. If you use expenses toward a credit, you must add them back to income—no double dipping. Track eligibility carefully.

$

529 Plan Contributions (Personal Deduction)

Arizona allows a deduction up to $2,000 ($4,000 joint) for contributions to 529 college savings plans. This is a personal deduction on Form 140, not a business write-off. It won’t affect your Schedule C or SBI return.

$

State Tuition or Scholarship Contributions

Credits exist for donations to school tuition or vocational scholarship organizations. These are personal credits, not business deductions. Photography workshops and business training do not qualify for these state-specific education credits.

$

Cannabis Industry Deduction Example (FYI)

Arizona allows deductions for legal cannabis businesses, even though federal law disallows them. This example shows Arizona’s flexibility in honoring ordinary and necessary expenses—even if the IRS doesn’t. Photography is fully deductible.

$

Small Business Income (SBI) Return

Sole props can opt to file Form 140-SBI to tax business income at 2.5% separately. This removes Schedule C income from Form 140. Deductions must match what’s on your federal return—no new expenses allowed.

$

Pass-Through Entity (PTE) Tax Election

If you operate as an S-Corp or partnership, Arizona allows the PTE election. The business pays state tax directly, which creates a federal deduction. Not for sole props, but valuable if you upgrade to a multi-owner entity.
