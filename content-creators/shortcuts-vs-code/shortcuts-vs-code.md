*   Open Command Palette: `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) | `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
*   Quick Open Files: `Ctrl + P` (Windows) | `Cmd + P` (Mac)
*   Toggle Terminal: `Ctrl + backtick (``)` (Windows) | `Cmd + backtick (``)` (Mac)
*   Go to Line: `Ctrl + G` (Windows) | `Cmd + G` (Mac)

These shortcuts will help you move within your project quickly and efficiently.

Code Editing Shortcuts
----------------------

Editing code efficiently is vital for maintaining focus. Here are some indispensable editing shortcuts:

*   Copy Line: `Ctrl + C` (Windows) | `Cmd + C` (Mac)
