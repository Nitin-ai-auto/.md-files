These shortcuts help reduce mouse dependency, allowing for quicker access to different sections of your project.

3. Editor Shortcuts
-------------------

Once in the appropriate panel, knowing how to optimize your coding experience can enhance your speed and efficiency. Here are vital editor shortcuts:

*   Tab: Indent current line or selection
