What is the Airbnb Influencer Program?
--------------------------------------

The Airbnb Influencer Program is designed for social media influencers who wish to collaborate with Airbnb to promote listings, unique experiences, and travel storytelling. Although details about a formal program post-2021 are not widely available, influencers have continued to explore opportunities for partnerships with Airbnb hosts and the brand itself.

Why Work with Airbnb?
