How to Start an LLC in Arizona. A Step by Step Guide
----------------------------------------------------

Arizona offers one of the most business friendly environments in the Southwest. This makes it an attractive place for entrepreneurs to establish their companies. With low taxes, a growing population, and a strong small business ecosystem, forming an LLC in Arizona provides flexibility, legal protection, and access to a thriving market. Many business owners choose the LLC structure because it protects personal assets while keeping operations simple.

Arizona does not require annual reports for LLCs. This reduces long term compliance costs. The formation process is straightforward. You will complete a few required steps to register your LLC with the Arizona Corporation Commission. Below is a clear guide to each step so you can form your Arizona LLC confidently.

Steps to Start an LLC in Arizona
--------------------------------

### Step 1. Choose a Name for Your Arizona LLC

Your LLC name must be distinguishable from all other businesses registered in Arizona. You can use the Corporation Commission’s online search tool to check availability. Arizona does not require a name reservation. Still, you can reserve one for $10 if you want to hold it for 120 days.

*   Your name must include “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability Company.”
*   Restricted words may require additional approvals.
*   Your name should not imply government affiliation.

### Step 2. Appoint a Statutory Agent

Arizona requires every LLC to appoint a Statutory Agent. This is similar to a Registered Agent. The agent must have a physical Arizona address and be available during normal business hours. You can serve as your own agent. You may also appoint another individual or a professional registered agent service. Your LLC cannot act as its own agent.

### Step 3. File Articles of Organization

Your Arizona LLC officially begins once you file the Articles of Organization with the Arizona Corporation Commission. You may file online or by mail. The form includes your LLC name, address, Statutory Agent information, and management structure.

*   Online filing fee. $50
*   Expedited filing option. $85

Approval times vary. Online filings are typically processed faster than mailed submissions.

### Step 4. Publish a Notice of LLC Formation

Most Arizona LLCs must publish a Notice of LLC Formation in an approved local newspaper for three consecutive weeks. You must complete this step within 60 days of formation. The cost depends on the newspaper and county. LLCs located in Maricopa County or Pima County are exempt from publication because notices are automatically posted online by the state.

### Step 5. Create an Operating Agreement

An Operating Agreement is not required. Still, it is strongly recommended. This document outlines member rights, responsibilities, and internal procedures. It helps prevent disputes and keeps your LLC organized.

### Step 6. Obtain an EIN

Your LLC will need an EIN from the IRS if you plan to hire employees, open business bank accounts, or file federal taxes. You can apply for an EIN online at no cost. Most owners receive their number immediately.

### Step 7. Register for State Taxes or Licenses

Arizona LLCs may need a Transaction Privilege Tax license if they sell goods or taxable services. Some industries require additional state or local permits. Check with the Arizona Department of Revenue and your city government to ensure compliance.

How Much Does It Cost to Start an LLC in Arizona?
-------------------------------------------------

*   Articles of Organization. $50
*   Expedited Filing. $85
*   Name Reservation (optional). $10
*   Publication Costs (if required). Varies by county
