What is Gross Income?
---------------------

Gross income is the total amount of money you earn before any deductions or taxes are taken out. It is important for both individuals and businesses to understand their gross income because it helps them know how much money they have coming in. For example, if you earn money from your job, your gross income would be your salary before any taxes or other deductions are made.

Calculating gross income is straightforward. Here are some key points:

*   **For Individuals**: Add up all sources of income, including wages, bonuses, rental income, and investment earnings.
*   **For Businesses**: Add up all sales and income from services before subtracting any expenses.

For example, if you work a part-time job earning $500 a month and do freelance work earning $200 a month, your gross income would be $700 for that month.

### Why is Gross Income Important?

Understanding your gross income is essential for several reasons:

*   It helps you create a budget by knowing how much money you have available.

By keeping track of your gross income, you can make better financial decisions and plan for your future.

### How Does Gross Income Differ from Net Income?

It's also important to know the difference between gross income and net income:

*   **Gross Income**: Total earnings before any deductions.
*   **Net Income**: Amount left after taxes and other deductions are taken out.

For example, if your gross income is $1,000 and you pay $300 in taxes, your net income would be $700.
