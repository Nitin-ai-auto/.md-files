Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
=========================

What is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?
----------------------------------

The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs incurred in the production of goods or services that are sold by a business. This includes the cost of materials, labor, and other expenses that are directly tied to the creation of your product or service. For content creators and Influencers, COGS can include costs for physical products or services that are part of your creative process. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is a key part of the [Income Statement Components](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/income-statement), directly affecting [gross profit](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/gross-profit)and overall business profitability.

For example, if you're a photographer selling prints, your COGS would include the cost of the photo paper, ink, and shipping materials.

How to Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
------------------------------------------

Calculating your Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) helps you understand the direct expenses involved in producing the products or services you sell.

### What Is Cost of Goods Sold Formula

**The COGS formula is:**

> **_COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases During the Period - Ending Inventory_**

This formula helps you determine the cost of all goods sold during a specific period.

#### **Step-by-step Calculation:**

1.   Beginning Inventory: This is the value of goods or materials you have at the start of the period.
2.   Purchases During the Period: Any materials or resources you’ve bought to create your work (e.g., new camera equipment, software licenses).
3.   Ending Inventory: The remaining unsold goods or materials at the end of the period.

#### **Example:**

Let’s say you're a Influencer, and here’s your breakdown:

*   Beginning Inventory: $500 worth of materials (e.g., paper, design software).
*   Purchases During the Period: $300 for new materials or software.
*   Ending Inventory: $200 worth of leftover materials.

**Your COGS would be:**

**_COGS = $500 + $300 - $200 = $600_**

This means your cost to produce the items or services you sold is $600.

‍

**Reduce manual work and keep track of your expenses easily.**

Why COGS Matters for Creators in 2025
-------------------------------------

Correctly reporting COGS helps lower your taxable income, which means you could owe less in taxes. For the 2025 tax season, this is particularly important as the IRS continues to increase focus on digital entrepreneurs and creator-led businesses.

How to Find Cost of Goods Sold
------------------------------

To find your Cost of Goods Sold, simply plug your numbers into the COGS formula:

*   Identify your beginning inventory.
*   Add all purchases made during the accounting period.
*   Subtract the ending inventory from this total.

What is _Not_ Included in COGS?
-------------------------------

*   Advertising and marketing expenses
*   Software subscriptions
*   Office rent or utilities
*   Labor not tied directly to product creation

These are still deductible — just not as part of COGS. They fall under operational expenses.

Is Cost of Goods Sold an Expense?
---------------------------------

Yes, COGS is an expense. It's a key part of your business’s [operating expenses](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/operating-expense). For content creators, COGS represents the investment in physical or digital materials you use to produce and sell your work. It impacts your gross profit, as higher COGS means lower profits, and vice versa.

Why is Cost of Goods Sold Important for Creators?
-------------------------------------------------

Understanding how to calculate the cost of goods sold is vital for setting pricing, managing expenses, and ensuring profitability. Here's why it matters for different creative fields:

*   Podcasters & Musicians: Costs might include studio time, equipment, and software for editing and production.
*   Photographers & Designers: COGS could include materials like prints, photo paper, ink, and camera gear.
*   Filmmakers & Video Editors: This includes the cost of video equipment, software, and post-production tools.
*   Freelance Writers & Visual Artists: COGS may cover software subscriptions, printing costs, and any purchased assets like stock photos.

How to Find Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
-------------------------------------

You can find your COGS by looking at your financial records, including purchase receipts, sales records, and inventory logs. This is where accurate tracking of your expenses is crucial. If you're unsure, consult your accountant or use accounting software to help track these costs.

FAQs
----

### What is the main difference between COGS and operating expenses?



COGS refers to the direct costs of producing goods or services, whereas operating expenses include all other costs of running your business, such as marketing, rent, and salaries.

### How often should I calculate my COGS?



Ideally, you should calculate COGS on a monthly or quarterly basis to monitor your profitability and adjust pricing or costs as needed.

### Can I include all costs in COGS?



No, only the direct costs related to production can be included in COGS. Indirect expenses, such as advertising or administrative costs, should not be included.

### Does COGS affect my taxes?



Yes, COGS is deductible from your revenue, which reduces your taxable income and overall tax liability.

### If I don’t sell a product, do I still count the COGS for that product?



No. If the product wasn’t sold, it remains in your inventory, and its cost isn’t counted as COGS until it’s sold.
