What is Accrual Accounting?
---------------------------

Accrual accounting is a way of keeping [track of money](https://joinotto.com/reporting) that happens when you earn it or spend it, not just when you actually receive or pay cash. This means that if you do a job in January but get paid in February, you still count it as income for January. This method helps businesses understand how much money they really have coming in and going out over a period of time.

### How Does Accrual Accounting Work?

In accrual accounting, there are two main concepts:

*   **Revenue Recognition:** This means you record income when you earn it, even if the money isn't in the bank yet.
*   **Expense Recognition:** This means you record expenses when you incur them, not when you pay for them.

For example, if a company sells a product in March but only receives the payment in April, they still record that sale in March's income. This gives a clearer picture of the [business's financial performance](https://joinotto.com/reporting).
