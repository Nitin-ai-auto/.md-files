Budget Variance
===============

What is Budget Variance?
------------------------

A **budget variance** occurs when there is a difference between what you planned to spend (the budget) and what you actually spent. Understanding budget variance is important because it helps you see where your money is going and if you need to make any changes in the future. It’s like making a plan for your allowance but then realizing you either spent too much or saved more than you expected.

### Why Does Budget Variance Happen?

Budget variances can happen for various reasons, including:

*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Things like surprise bills or extra costs for activities can cause you to spend more than planned.
*   **Changes in Income**: If you earn more or less than you expected, it can affect your budget.
*   **Unplanned Savings**: Sometimes, you might spend less than planned, which is a good surprise!

### How to Analyze Budget Variance?

To understand budget variance better, you can follow these steps:

1.   **Calculate the Variance**: Subtract the actual amount spent from the budgeted amount. If the result is positive, you spent less; if it's negative, you overspent.
2.   **Review the Reasons**: Look at why the variance happened and if it was something you could control.
3.   **Adjust Future Budgets**: Use what you learned to make better budget plans next time.

Understanding budget variance helps you manage money wisely, preparing you for future expenses and savings!
