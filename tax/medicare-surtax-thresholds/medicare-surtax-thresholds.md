Medicare Surtax Thresholds
==========================

Medicare Surtax: Additional Taxes on High Earners
-------------------------------------------------

The Medicare surtax, also known as the Additional Medicare Tax, applies to high-income individuals. This tax helps fund Medicare and is in addition to the standard Medicare tax withheld from wages.

### Who Pays the Medicare Surtax?

The surtax applies to individuals earning above certain thresholds:

*   $250,000 for married couples filing jointly.
*   $200,000 for single filers.
*   $125,000 for married individuals filing separately.

### Rate and Calculation

The Medicare surtax is 0.9% of wages, compensation, or self-employment income above the applicable threshold. Employers are required to withhold the surtax once wages exceed $200,000, regardless of filing status.
