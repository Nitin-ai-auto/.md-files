What is PVR?
------------

PVR stands for **Projected Value of Receivables**. It is an important concept in accounting and finance that helps businesses understand the expected income from customers who owe money. In simpler terms, it estimates how much money a business can expect to collect from its unpaid invoices over time. Knowing your PVR can help you plan your finances better and ensure that you have enough cash flow to keep your business running.

### Why is PVR Important?

Understanding the PVR is crucial for several reasons:

*   **Cash Flow Management**: By knowing how much money you are likely to collect, you can manage your cash flow effectively and avoid financial issues.
*   **Budgeting**: PVR helps you set realistic budgets because you will have a clearer picture of your expected income.
*   **Risk Assessment**: By assessing your PVR, you can identify potential risks associated with unpaid invoices, allowing you to take proactive measures.

### How is PVR Calculated?

PVR is calculated using the following steps:

1.   **Collect Data**: Gather information on all outstanding invoices and payment history from customers.
2.   **Estimate Collection Rates**: Determine how much of the outstanding receivables you expect to collect based on past experiences.
3.   **Calculate Projected Value**: Use the formula: **PVR = Total Outstanding Receivables × Estimated Collection Rate**.

This calculation gives you a clear idea of the income you can expect from your receivables, helping you make informed financial decisions.

### How to Improve Your PVR?

Here are some strategies to enhance your PVR:

*   **Prompt Invoicing**: Send out invoices as soon as services are rendered or products are delivered to encourage faster payments.
*   **Follow Up on Payments**: Regularly check in with clients who have overdue invoices to remind them of outstanding payments.
