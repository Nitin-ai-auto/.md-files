What is Earned Income?
----------------------

Earned income refers to the money you make from working for someone or providing services. This income comes from various sources such as your job, freelance work, or business activities. Unlike other types of income, like interest from savings or dividends from investments, earned income requires you to actively participate in creating value through work. It is a crucial part of personal finance as it forms the basis for most people's livelihoods.

### What Are Examples of Earned Income?

Earned income can take many forms, and understanding these can help you identify your own sources. Some common examples include:

*   **Salary:** Money received from a regular job.
*   **Wages:** Hourly pay from jobs like retail or food service.
*   **Freelance Income:** Payment for services offered independently, like graphic design or writing.
*   **Business Revenue:** Money earned from running your own business.

### Why is Earned Income Important?

Earned income is vital because it provides the funds necessary for daily living expenses, savings, and investments. Here’s why it matters:

*   **Financial Stability:** It is often the primary source of income for individuals and families.
*   **Tax Implications:** Earned income is generally subject to income tax, and it can also affect benefits like Social Security.
*   **Future Opportunities:** A steady earned income stream can open doors for better job opportunities and career advancement.

### How is Earned Income Different from Other Types?

Understanding the difference between earned income and other types of income can help you manage your finances better. Here are some distinctions:

*   **Passive Income:** This is income earned without actively working, such as rental income or dividends from investments.
*   **Portfolio Income:** Money earned from selling stocks or other investments.

In summary, earned income is the foundation of financial health for most individuals and families. Recognizing its importance and differences from other forms of income can help in effective financial planning and decision-making.
