-----------------------------------------

Bad debt refers to money owed to you that you cannot collect. Whether you are an individual or a business, the IRS allows taxpayers to write off bad debts under certain circumstances. Understanding the rules for claiming bad debt deductions can help reduce your taxable income and ensure [tax compliance](https://joinotto.com/tax-compliance) with federal tax laws.

### What is Considered Bad Debt?

Bad debt is defined as a financial obligation that has become uncollectible. There are two main types of bad debts:

*   **Business Bad Debt:** Debts incurred in the course of operating a business, such as unpaid customer invoices or loans to clients.
*   **Non-Business Bad Debt:** Personal loans or credit extended to individuals that are not related to a trade or business.

### Criteria for Writing Off Bad Debt

To claim a bad debt deduction, the IRS requires that the debt meets the following criteria:

*   The debt must be a bona fide debt, meaning it arises from a debtor-creditor relationship based on a valid and enforceable obligation to repay.
*   You must have a basis in the debt, meaning you have already included the debt amount in your income or lent actual funds.
*   The debt must be worthless, meaning you have taken reasonable steps to collect it without success.

### How to Write Off Bad Debt

Follow these steps to claim a bad debt deduction:

1.   **Determine Worthlessness:** Document your efforts to collect the debt, such as written correspondence, legal action, or settlement attempts.
2.   **Classify the Debt:** Identify whether the bad debt is a business or non-business debt. This classification determines how it is reported.
3.   **Report the Deduction:**
    *   **For Business Bad Debt:** Deduct the amount on your business tax return. Sole proprietors use Schedule C, while corporations report it on Form 1120.
    *   **For Non-Business Bad Debt:** Report it as a short-term capital loss on Form 8949, "Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets."

### Limits on Bad Debt Deductions

There are limits and restrictions on bad debt deductions:

*   Non-business bad debt deductions are limited to the amount of your capital gains plus up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) of other income per year. Excess losses can be carried forward to future years.
*   Business bad debts have no such limitation and are fully deductible against business income.

### Records to Keep

The IRS may require proof that the debt is bona fide and has become worthless. Maintain the following records:

*   A copy of the original loan agreement or promissory note.
*   Documentation of payments received (if any).
*   Evidence of collection efforts, such as correspondence or court filings.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   Claiming a bad debt deduction without sufficient documentation.
*   Deducting debts that are still collectible.
*   Misclassifying a personal gift as a bad debt.

### Tips for Managing Bad Debt

*   Establish clear terms and agreements for loans or credit extended.
*   Monitor receivables regularly and follow up on overdue payments promptly.
*   Consult a tax professional to ensure proper [reporting](https://joinotto.com/reporting) and [compliance](https://joinotto.com/tax-compliance) with IRS rules.
