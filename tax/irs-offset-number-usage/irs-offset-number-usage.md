IRS Offset Number Usage
=======================

IRS Offset Number: Understanding Tax Refund Offsets
---------------------------------------------------

The IRS offset process involves redirecting a taxpayer’s federal tax refund to pay off outstanding debts such as unpaid taxes, child support, or student loans. The IRS Offset Number refers to the toll-free number taxpayers can call to inquire about refund offsets. Understanding how offsets work and the steps to address them can help taxpayers manage their finances effectively.

### What is a Tax Refund Offset?

A tax refund offset occurs when the Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) applies all or part of your federal tax refund to satisfy certain debts. Common types of debts subject to offsets include:

*   Past-due federal or state taxes.
*   Delinquent child support payments.
*   Defaulted student loans.
*   Other federal agency debts.

### How to Check for an Offset

To check if your refund has been offset:

*   Call the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) at 1-800-304-3107.
*   Review any notices received from the IRS or BFS explaining the offset.

### Steps to Address a Refund Offset

If you believe your refund has been offset in error, or you want to address the debt:

1.   **Contact the Creditor Agency:** Reach out to the agency listed in the offset notice to resolve the debt.
2.   **Request a Review:** If you dispute the debt, request a review with the creditor agency.
3.   **Adjust Withholding:** Modify your tax withholding to avoid overpaying taxes if you anticipate future offsets.
